<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT seems fitting that this little book of
personal testimonies to answered prayer
should have a brief introductory word as to
how they came to be written. The question
has been asked by some who read many of
these testimonies as they appeared in the
pages of The Sunday School Times: "How
could you write such personal and sacred
incidents in your life?" I could not have
written them but for a very clear, God-given
leading.</div>

<p>The story is as follows: When in Canada
on our first furloughs I was frequently
amazed at the incredulity expressed when
definite testimony was given to an answer to
prayer. Sometimes this was shown by an
expressive shrug of the shoulders, sometimes
by a sudden silence or turning of the topic of
conversation, and sometimes more openly by
the query: "How do you know that it might
not have happened so, anyway?"</p>

<p>Gradually the impression deepened: "If
they will not believe one, two, or a dozen testimonies,
will they believe the combined testimonies
of one whole life?"</p>

<p>The more I thought of what it would mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
to record the sacred incidents connected with
answers to prayer the more I shrank from
the publicity, and from undertaking the task.
There were dozens of answers far too sacred
for the public eye, which were known only to
a few, others known only to God. But if the
record were to carry weight with those who
did not believe in the supernatural element in
prayer, many personal and scarcely less sacred
incidents must of necessity be made
public.</p>

<p>Again and again I laid the matter aside as
impossible. But I know now that the thing
was of God. As months, even years, passed,
the impelling sense that the record of answers
to prayer <i>must</i> be written gave me no rest.</p>

<p>It was at the close of the 1908-10 furlough&mdash;during
which, as a family, we had been
blessed with many and, to our weak faith,
wonderful answers to prayer&mdash;that my oldest
son urged me to put down in some definite
form the answers to prayer of my life, and
extracted from me a solemn promise that I
would do so.</p>

<p>But months passed after returning to
China, and the record had not been touched.
Then came a sudden and serious illness which
threatened my life, when the doctor told me
I must not delay in getting my affairs in
order.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span></p>

<p>It was then that an overwhelming sense of
regret took possession of me that I had not
set down the prayer testimonies, and solemnly
I covenanted with the Lord that if he
would raise me up they should be written.</p>

<p>There was no more question of what
others might think; the one thought was to
obey. The Lord raised me up; and although
he had to deal with me very sternly once
more before I really set myself to the task,
the testimonies that are given here were
written at last&mdash;most of them in odd moments
of time during strenuous missionary
journeys among the heathen.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that these incidents of
answered prayer are not given as being more
wonderful, or more worthy of record, than
multitudes the world over could testify to;
but they are written and sent out simply
and only because <i>I had to write them or disobey
God</i>.</p>

<h3>"GETTING THINGS FROM GOD"</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings,
and not one of them is forgotten before
God?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Fear not therefore: ye are of more
value than many sparrows."&mdash;<i>The Lord Jesus
Christ.</i></p></div>


<div class='cap'>THE pages of this little book deal almost
wholly with just one phase of prayer&mdash;petition.
The record is almost entirely a
personal testimony of what petition to my
Heavenly Father has meant in meeting the
everyday crises of my life.</div>

<p>A prominent Christian worker, who read
some of these testimonies in The Sunday
School Times, said to the writer: "To emphasize
getting things from God, as you do,
is to make prayer too material."</p>

<p>To me this seems far from true. God is
my Father, I am his child. As truly as I delight
to be sought for by my child when he is
cold or hungry, ill, or in need of protection,
so is it with my Heavenly Father.</p>

<p>Prayer has been hedged about with too
many man-made rules. I am convinced that
God has intended prayer to be as simple and
natural, and as constant a part of our spiritual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
life, as the intercourse between a child
and his parent in the home. And as a large
part of that intercourse between child and
parent is simply asking and receiving, just so
is it with us and our Heavenly Parent.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the most blessed element
in this asking and getting from God lies
in the strengthening of faith which comes
when a definite request has been granted.
What more helpful and inspiring than a ringing
testimony of <i>what God has done</i>?</p>

<p>As I have recalled the past in writing these
incidents, one of the most precious memories
is that of an evening when a number of
friends had gathered in our home. The conversation
turned on answered prayer. For
more than two hours we vied with one another
in recounting personal incidents of
God's wonderful work; and the inspiration of
that evening still abides.</p>

<p>A Christian minister once said to me: "Is
it possible that the great God of the universe,
the Maker and Ruler of mankind, could or
would, as you would make out, take interest
in such a trifle as the trimming of a hat! To
me it is preposterous!"</p>

<p>Yet did not our Lord Jesus Christ say:
"The very hairs of your head are all numbered";
and "not one sparrow is forgotten
before God"; and again, "Your heavenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Father knoweth what ye have need of <i>before</i>
ye ask him"?</p>

<p>It is true that "There is nothing too great
for God's power"; and it is just as true that
"There is nothing too small for his love!"</p>

<p>If we believe God's Word we must believe,
as Dan Crawford has tersely and beautifully
expressed it, that "The God of the infinite is
the God of the infinitesimal." Yes, he</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Who clears the grounding berg<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And guides the grinding floe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He hears the cry of the little kit fox</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the lemming of the snow!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>No more wonderful testimony, perhaps,
has ever been given of God's willingness to
help in every emergency of life, than that
which Mary Slessor gave, when asked to tell
what prayer had meant to her. "My life,"
she wrote, "is one long daily, hourly record
of answered prayer. For physical health,
for mental overstrain, for guidance given
marvelously, for errors and dangers everted,
for enmity to the Gospel subdued, for food
provided at the exact hour needed, for everything
that goes to make up life and my poor
service. I can testify, with a full and
often wonder-stricken awe, that I believe
God answers prayer. <i>I know God answers
prayer!</i>"</p>

<p>I have been asked the question: "Has God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<i>always</i> given you just what you have asked
for?"</p>

<p>Oh, no! For him to have done so would
have been great unkindness. For instance:
when I was a young woman I prayed for
three years that God would grant me a certain
petition. Sometimes I pleaded for this as for
life itself, so intensely did I want it. Then
God showed me very clearly that I was praying
against his will. I resigned my will to
his in the matter, and a few months later God
gave what was infinitely better. I have
often praised him for denying my prayer;
for had he granted it I could never have come
to China.</p>

<p>Then, too, we must remember that many
of our prayers, though always heard, are not
granted because of some sin harbored in the
life, or because of unbelief, or of failure to
meet some other Bible-recorded condition
governing prevailing prayer. (See Bible
Study on pages 129, 130.)</p>

<p>The following incidents of answered
prayer are by no means a complete record.
How could they be, when no record of prayer
has been kept all these fifty years? Had
there been, I doubt not that volumes could
have been written to the glory of God's grace
and power in answering prayer. But even
from what is recorded here I, too, can say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
from a full heart, <i>I know God answers
prayer</i>.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"He answered prayer: so sweetly that I stand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Amid the blessing of his wondrous hand</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And marvel at the miracle I see,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The favours that his love hath wrought for me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pray on for the impossible, and dare</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Upon thy banner this brave motto bear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'My Father answers prayer.'"</span><br />

<h2>II</h2>

<h3>EARLY LESSONS IN THE<br />
LIFE OF FAITH</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I love the Lord, because he hath heard
my voice and my supplications."&mdash;<i>Psalm
116:1.</i></p></div>


<div class='cap'>WHEN a very little child, so young I can
remember nothing earlier, a severe
thunderstorm passed over our home. Terrified,
I ran to my mother, who placed my
hands together, and pointing upward repeated
over and over again the one word
"Jesus."</div>

<p>More than fifty years have passed since
that day, but the impression left upon my
child-mind, of a Being invisible but able to
hear and help, has never been effaced.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The most precious recollections of early
childhood are associated with stories told us
by our mother, many of which illustrated the
power of prayer.</p>

<p>One that made a specially deep impression
upon me was about our grandfather, who as
a little boy went to visit cousins in the south
of England, their home being situated close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to a dense forest. One day the children,
lured by the beautiful wild flowers, became
hopelessly lost in the woods. After trying in
vain to find a way out, the eldest, a young
girl, called the frightened, crying little ones
around her and said: "When mother died she
told us to always tell Jesus if we were in any
trouble. Let us kneel down, and ask him to
take us home."</p>

<p>They knelt, and as she prayed one of the
little ones opened his eyes, to find a bird so
close to his hand that he reached out for it.
The bird hopped away, but kept so close to
the child as to lead him on. Soon all were
joining in the chase after the bird, which
flew or hopped in front or just above, and
sometimes on the ground almost within
reach. Then suddenly it flew into the air
and away. The children looked up to find
themselves on the edge of the woods and in
sight of home.</p>

<p>With such influences bearing upon one at
an impressionable age, it is not surprising
that I came even as a very little child to just
"tell Jesus" when in trouble.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Through the mists of memory one incident
comes out clearly, which occurred when I
was six or seven years of age. While playing
one day in the garden, I was seized with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
what we then called "jumping" toothache. I
ran to my mother for comfort, but nothing
she could do seemed to ease the pain.</p>

<p>The nerve must have become exposed, for
the pain was acute. Suddenly I thought,
"Jesus can help me," and just as I was, with
my face pressed against my mother's breast,
I said in my heart:</p>

<p>"Lord Jesus, if you will take away this
toothache right now, <i>now</i>, I will be your little
girl for three years."</p>

<p>Before the prayer was well uttered the pain
was entirely gone. I believed that Jesus had
taken it away; and the result was that for
years, when tempted to be naughty, I was
afraid to do what I knew was wrong lest, if
I broke my side of what I felt to be a compact,
the toothache would return. This little
incident had a real influence over my early
life, gave me a constant sense of the reality
of a divine presence, and so helped to prepare
me for the public confession of Christ as my
Saviour a few years later, at the age of
eleven.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>About a year after my confession of Christ
an incident occurred which greatly strengthened
my faith, and led me to look to God as a
Father in a new way.</p>

<p>When Easter Sunday morning came it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
so warm only spring clothes could be worn.
My sister and I decided at breakfast that we
would not go to church, as we had only
our old winter dresses. Going to my room,
I turned to my Bible to study it, when it
opened at the sixth chapter of Matthew, and
my eye rested on these words: "Why take ye
thought for raiment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. seek ye first the kingdom
of God, and all these things shall be
added unto you."</p>

<p>It was as if God spoke the words directly
to me. I determined to go to church, even if
I had to humiliate myself by going in my old
winter dress. The Lord was true to his
promise; I can still feel the power the resurrection
messages had upon my heart that day
so long ago. And further, on the following
day a box came from a distant aunt, containing
not only new dresses but much else that
might well be included in the "all these
things."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>An unforgetable proof of God's loving
care came to us as a family about this time,
when my parents were face to face with a
serious financial crisis. Isaiah 65:24 was
literally fulfilled: "Before they call, I will
answer; and while they are yet speaking, I
will hear."</p>

<p>At that time, it is necessary to state, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
depended on a quarterly income, which came
through my mother's lawyer in England.
Unusual circumstances had so drained our
resources that we found ourselves, in the
middle of the quarter, with barely sufficient
to meet a week's needs. My dear mother
assured us that the Lord would provide; that
he would not forsake those who put their
trust in him. That very day a letter came
from the lawyer in England, enclosing a
draft for a sum ample to meet our needs till
the regular remittance should arrive. This
unexpected and timely draft proved to be a
bonus, which did not occur again.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Some years later, having moved to a
strange city, a great longing came to do some
definite service for my Master. One day
there came to the Bible class I attended a call
for teachers, to aid in a Sunday-school near
by. When I presented myself before the
superintendent of this Sunday-school the following
Sunday, and offered my services, it
is not much wonder I received a rebuff, for I
was young and quite unknown. I was told
that if I wished a class, it would be well for
me to find my own scholars. I can remember
how a lump seemed choking me all the
way home that day.</p>

<p>At last, determining not to be baffled, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
prayed the Lord to help me get some scholars.
I went forth praying every step of the way,
the following Saturday afternoon; and canvassing
just one short street near our home,
I received the promise of nineteen children
for Sunday-school. The next day a rather
victorious young woman walked up to the
Sunday-school superintendent with seventeen
children following. Needless to say I was
given a class.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1885 the Toronto Mission
Union, a faith mission, decided to establish
a branch mission in the East End slums
of that city. Three others with myself were
deputed to open this work. Everything connected
with it was entirely new to me; but
most helpful and inspiring I found it. For
in face of tremendous difficulties, that seemed
to my inexperienced eyes insurmountable, I
learned that prayer was the secret which
overcame every obstacle, the key that unlocked
every closed door.</p>

<p>I felt like a child learning a new and wonderful
lesson&mdash;as I saw benches, tables,
chairs, stove, fuel, lamps, oil, even an organ,
coming in answer to definite prayer for these
things. But best sight of all was when men
and women, deep in sin, were converted and
changed into workers for God, in answer to
prayer. Praise God for the lessons then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
learned, which were invaluable later when
facing the heathen.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The time came when two diverse paths lay
before me&mdash;one to England, as an artist;
one to China, as a missionary. Circumstances
made a definite decision most difficult.
I thought I had tried every means to find out
God's will for me, and no light had come.</p>

<p>But in a day of great trouble, when my
precious mother's very life seemed to hang
in the balance, I shut myself up with God's
Word, praying definitely for him to guide me
to some passage by which I might know his
will for my life. My Bible opening at the fifteenth
chapter of John's Gospel, the sixteenth
verse seemed to come as a message to me:
"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen
you, and ordained you, that ye should go and
bring forth fruit." Going to my dear mother
and telling her of the message God had given
me, she said: "I dare not fight against God."</p>

<p>From that time the last hindrance from
going to China was removed. Surely the
wonderful way God has kept his child for
more than thirty years in China is proof
that this "call" was not a mistaken one.
"In all thy ways acknowledge him, and
he will make plain thy paths" (Prov. 3:
6, marg.).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>During the summer of 1887 a book written
by Dr. Hudson Taylor came into my hands.
In "China's Spiritual Needs and Claims" the
writer told many instances of God's gracious
provision in answer to prayer. The incidents
related impressed me deeply. A little
later, a few weeks before my marriage, when
I found I was short fifty dollars of what I
would need to be married free of debt, I resolved
not to let others know of my need, but
to just trust God to send it to me. The
thought came&mdash;if you cannot trust God for
this, when Hudson Taylor could trust for so
much more, are you worthy to be a missionary?</p>

<p>It was my first experience of trusting quite
alone for money. I was sorely tempted to
give others just a hint of my need. But I
was kept back from doing so; and though I
had a week or more of severe testing, peace
of mind and the assurance that God would
supply my need, came at length. The answer,
however, did not come till the very last
night before the wedding.</p>

<p>That evening a number of my fellow-workers
from the East End Mission called, and
presented me with a beautifully illuminated
address and a purse. After these friends had
left I returned to my home circle assembled
in the back parlor, and showed them the address<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and the purse unopened! Not for a
moment did I think there was anything in the
purse till my brother said: "You foolish girl,
why don't you open it?" I opened the purse,
and found it contained a check for fifty
dollars!</p>

<p>This incident has ever remained peculiarly
precious; for it seemed to us a seal of God
upon the new life opening before us.</p>

<h3>"GO FORWARD ON YOUR KNEES"<br />

1887-1894</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I will go before thee, and make the
crooked places straight: I will break in pieces
the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the
bars of iron" (Isa. 45:2).</p></div>


<div class='cap'>IN ATTEMPTING to record what prayer
meant in our early pioneer days, other than
purely personal testimonies must be given;
for we were, as a little band of missionaries,
bound together in our common needs and
dangers by a very close bond.</div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In October, 1887, my husband was appointed
by the Canadian Presbyterian
Church to open a new field, in the northern
section of the Province of Honan, China.
We left Canada the following January,
reaching China in March, 1888. Not till
then did we realize the tremendous difficulties
of the task before us.</p>

<p>Dr. Hudson Taylor, of the China Inland
Mission, writing to us at this time, said:
"We understand North Honan is to be your
field; we, as a mission, have tried for ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
years to enter that province from the south,
and have only just succeeded. It is one of
the most anti-foreign provinces in China.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Brother, if you would enter that province,
<i>you must go forward on your knees</i>."</p>

<p>These words gave the key-note to our early
pioneer years. Would that a faithful record
had been kept of God's faithfulness in answering
prayer! Our strength as a mission
and as individuals, during those years so
fraught with dangers and difficulties, lay in
the fact that we did realize the hopelessness
of our task apart from divine aid.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The following incident occurred while we
were still outside Honan, studying the language
at a sister mission. It illustrates the
importance of prayer from the home base for
those on the field.</p>

<p>My husband was finding great difficulty in
acquiring the language; he studied faithfully
many hours daily, but made painfully slow
progress. He and his colleague went regularly
together to the street chapel, to practise
preaching in Chinese to the people; but,
though Mr. Goforth had come to China
almost a year before the other missionary,
the people would ask the latter to speak instead
of Mr. Goforth, saying they understood
him better.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, just before starting as usual for
the chapel, my husband said: "If the Lord
does not give me very special help in this
language I fear I shall be a failure as a
missionary."</p>

<p>Some hours later he returned, his face
beaming with joy. He told me that he realized
most unusual help when his turn came to
speak; sentences came to his mind as never
before; and not only had he made himself
understood, but some had appeared much
moved, coming up afterward to have further
conversation with him. So delighted and encouraged
was he with this experience that
he made a careful note of it in his diary.</p>

<p>Some two months and a half later a letter
came from a student in Knox College, saying
that on a certain evening a number of students
had met specially to pray for Mr. Goforth.
The power of prayer was such, and
the presence of God so manifestly felt, that
they decided to write and ask Mr. Goforth if
any special help had come to him at that time.
Looking in his diary, he found that the time
of their meeting corresponded with that time
of special help in the language.</p>

</div>

<p>At last the joyful news reached us women,
waiting outside of Honan, that our brethren
had secured property in two centers. It
would be difficult for those in the homeland
to understand what the years of waiting had
meant to some of us. The danger to those
dear to us, touring in Honan, was very great.
For years they never left us to go on a tour
without our being filled with dread lest they
should never return; yet the Lord, in his
mercy, heard our prayers for them; and
though often in grave danger, none received
serious injury. This is not a history of the
mission, but I cannot forbear giving here one
incident illustrating how they were kept during
those early days.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Two of our brethren, after renting property
at a town just within the boundary of
Honan, and near the Wei River, moved in,
intending to spend the winter there; but a
sudden and bitter persecution arose, just as
they had become settled. The mission premises<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
were attacked by a mob, and everything
was looted. The two men were roughly
handled, one being dragged about the courtyard.
They found themselves at last left
alone, their lives spared, but everything gone.</p>

<p>Their position was serious in the extreme&mdash;several
days' journey away from friends,
with no money, no bedding, and no clothes
but those upon them, and the cold winter
begun.</p>

<p>In their extremity, they knelt down and
committed themselves to the Lord. And
according to his promise he delivered them
out of their distresses; for even while they
prayed a brother missionary from a distant
station was at hand. He arrived unexpectedly,
without knowing what had occurred, a
few hours after the looting had taken place.
His coming at such an opportune moment
filled the hearts of their heathen enemies with
fear. Money and goods were returned, and
from that time the violent opposition of the
people ceased.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A few months after the above incident
several families moved into Honan, and a
permanent occupation was effected; but the
hearts of the people seemed as adamant
against us. They hated and distrusted us
as if we were their worst enemies. The district<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in which we settled was known for its
turbulent and anti-foreign spirit, and as a
band of missionaries we were frequently in
the gravest danger.</p>

<p>Many times we realized that we, as well as
our fellow-workers at the other stations, were
kept from serious harm only by the over-ruling,
protecting power of God in answer to
the many prayers which were going up for
us all at this critical juncture in the history of
our mission. The following are concrete examples
of how God heard our prayers at this
time.</p>

<p>We had for our station doctor a man of
splendid gifts. He was a gold medalist, with
years of special training and hospital experience,
and was looked upon as one of the rising
physicians in the city from which he
came. Imagine his disappointment, therefore,
when month after month passed and
scarcely a good case came to the hospital.
The people did not know what he could do,
and moreover they were afraid to trust themselves
into his hands. We, as a little band
of missionaries, began to pray definitely that
the Lord would send cases to the hospital
which would open the hearts of the people
toward us and our message.</p>

<p>It was not long before we saw this prayer
answered beyond all expectation. Several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
very important cases came almost together,
one so serious that the doctor hesitated for
days before operating. When at last the
operation did take place the doctor's hands
were strengthened by our prayers, the patient
came through safely, and a few days later
was going around a living wonder to the
people.</p>

<p>Very much depended upon the outcome of
this and other serious operations. Had the
patients died under the doctor's hands, it
would have been quite sufficient to have
caused the destruction of the mission premises
and the life of every missionary. Three
years later the hospital records showed that
there had been twenty-eight thousand treatments
in one year.</p>

<p>Again, we kept praying that the Lord
would give us converts from the very beginning.
We had heard of missionaries in India,
China, and elsewhere, who had worked for
many years without gaining converts; but we
did not believe that this was God's will for
us. We believed that it was his pleasure and
purpose to save men and women through his
human channels, and why not from the beginning?
So we kept praying and working
and expecting converts, and God gave them
to us. The experience of thirty years has
confirmed this belief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Space permits the mention of but two of
these earliest converts.</p>

<p>The first was Wang Feng-ao, who came
with us into Honan as Mr. Goforth's personal
teacher. He was a man of high degree,
equal to the Western M. A., and was
one of the proudest and most overbearing of
Confucian scholars. He despised the missionaries
and their teaching, and so great was
his opposition that he would beat his wife
every time she came to see us or listen to our
message. But Mr. Goforth kept praying for
this man, and using all his influence to win
him for Christ.</p>

<p>Before many months passed a great change
had come over Mr. Wang; his proud, overbearing
manner had changed, and he became
a humble, devout follower of the lowly Nazarene.
God used a dream to awaken this man's
conscience&mdash;as is not uncommon in China.
One night he dreamed he was struggling in a
deep, miry pit; but try as he would he could
find no way of escape. When about to give
up in despair, he looked up and saw Mr. Goforth
and another missionary on the bank
above him, with their hands stretched out to
save him. Again he sought for some other
way of escape; but finding none, he allowed
them to draw him up.</p>

<p>This man, later on, became Mr. Goforth's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
most valued evangelist. For many years his
splendid gifts were used to the glory of his
Master in the work among the scholar class
in the Changtefu district. He has long since
passed to his reward, dying as he had lived,
trusting only in the merit of Jesus Christ for
salvation.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Another of the bright glints, in the darkness
of those earliest days in Honan, was the
remarkable conversion of Wang Fu-Lin. For
many years his business had been that of a
public story-teller; but when Mr. Goforth
came across him he was reduced to an utter
wreck through opium smoking. He accepted
the Gospel, but for a long time seemed too
weak to break off the opium habit. Again
and again he tried to do so, but failed hopelessly
each time.</p>

<p>The poor fellow seemed almost past hope,
when one day Mr. Goforth brought him to
the mission in his cart. The ten days that
followed can never be forgotten by those who
watched Wang Fu-Lin struggle for physical
and spiritual life. I verily believe nothing
but prayer could have brought him through.
At the end of the ten days the power of
opium was broken, and Wang Fu-Lin came
out of the struggle a new man in Christ
Jesus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall have occasion to speak of this man
again.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In all the cases of divine healing cited in
this record it will be noted that God healed in
answer to prayer either when the doctors had
done all in their power and hope had been
abandoned, or when we were out of reach of
medical aid.</p>

<p>Soon after coming to China the Rev. Hunter
Corbett, one of the most devoted and
saintly of God's missionaries, gave a testimony
which later was used of God to save the
writer from giving up service in China and
returning home to Canada.</p>

<p>Dr. Corbett said that for fifteen years he
had been laid aside every year with that terrible
scourge of the East&mdash;dysentery; and the
doctors at last gave a definite decision that he
must return at once to the homeland and forsake
China. But, said the grand old man:
"I knew God had called me to China, and I
also knew that God did not change. So what
could I do? I dared not go back on my call;
so I determined that if I could not live in
China I could die there; and from that time
the disease lost its hold on me."</p>

<p>This testimony was given over twenty-five
years ago, when he had been almost thirty
years in China! In January, 1920, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
well-nigh ninety years of age, this beloved
and honored saint of God passed to higher
service.</p>

<p>For several years I had been affected just
as Dr. Corbett had been, and each year the
terrible disease seemed to be getting a firmer
hold upon me. At last, one day my husband
brought me the decision of the doctors, that I
should return home. And as I lay there ill
and weak, the temptation came to yield. But,
as I remembered Dr. Corbett's testimony, and
my own clear call, I felt that to go back would
be to go against my own conscience. I therefore
determined to do as Dr. Corbett had
done&mdash;leave myself in the Lord's hands&mdash;whether
for life or for death. This happened
more than twenty years ago, and since then I
have had very little trouble from that dread
disease.</p>

<p>Yes, the deeper the need, and the more
bitter the extremity, the greater the opportunity
for God to show forth his mighty power
in our lives, if we but give him a chance by
unswerving obedience at any cost. "In the
day when I cried thou answeredst me, and
strengthenedst me with strength in my soul"
(Psa. 138:3).</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>During our fourth year in China, when we
were spending the hot season at the coast, our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
little son, eighteen months old, was taken
very ill with dysentery. After several days'
fight for the child's life came the realization,
one evening, that the angel of death was at
hand.</p>

<p>My whole soul rebelled; I actually seemed
to hate God; I could see nothing but cruel injustice
in it all; and the child seemed to be
fast going. My husband and I knelt down
beside the little one's bedside, and he pleaded
earnestly with me to yield my will and my
child to God. After a long and bitter struggle
God gained the victory, and I told my
husband I would give my child to the Lord.
Then my husband prayed, committing the
precious soul into the Lord's keeping.</p>

<p>While he was praying I noticed that the
rapid, hard breathing of the child had ceased.
Thinking my darling was gone, I hastened
for a light, for it was dark; but on examining
the child's face I found that he had sunk into
a deep, sound, natural sleep, which lasted
most of the night. The following day he
was practically well of the dysentery.</p>

<p>To me it has always seemed that the Lord
tested me to almost the last moment; then,
when I yielded my dearest treasure to him
and put my Lord first, he gave back the child.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>While writing the above I came across an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
extract from the Christian of March 12,
1914, in which the editor said:</p>

<p>"Speaking at the annual meeting of the
Huntingdon County Hospital, Lord Sandwich
referred to the power of spiritual healing,
and premising that the finite mind cannot
measure the power of the infinite, said he
'looked forward to the day when the spiritual
doctrine of healing and the physical discoveries
of science will blend in harmonious
combination, to the glory of God and the
benefit of humanity.'"</p>

<h3>A GOD-GIVEN FIELD (1894-1900)</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Lord, there is none beside thee to help,
between the mighty and him that hath no
strength; help us, O Lord our God; for we
rely on thee, and in thy name are come
against this multitude" (2 Chron. 14:11).</p></div>


<div class='cap'>THE story of the opening of Changte is
so connected by a chain of prayer that to
give isolated instances of prayer would be to
break the chain.</div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A few months after our arrival in China
an old, experienced missionary kindly volunteered
to conduct Mr. Goforth and his colleague,
who had just arrived, through North
Honan, that they might see the field for
themselves.</p>

<p>Traveling southward by cart, they crossed
the border into Honan early one morning.
As my husband walked beside the carts, that
morning, he felt led to pray that the Lord
would give that section of Honan to him as
his field. The assurance came that his
prayer was granted. Opening his daily textbook,
he found the passage for that morning
was from Isaiah 55:8-13. Like a precious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
promise of future blessing for that field came
the words: "As the rain cometh down, and
the snow from heaven, and returneth not
thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it
bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to
the sower, and bread to the eater: so shall my
word be that goeth forth out of my mouth:
it shall not return unto me void."</p>

<p>For six years, however, our faith was
sorely tested.</p>

<p>Of all places, Changte seemed most determined
to keep out the missionary. And there
were other difficulties in the way. A presbytery
had been formed as others joined us, and
all matters had to be decided by that body.
Two stations that had been opened, where a
foothold could first be gained, required all,
and more than all, the force we then had. So
for six years the door to Changte remained
fast closed. But during all those years Mr.
Goforth never once lost sight of God's promise
to him, nor failed to believe it.</p>

<p>Again and again, when Mr. Goforth and
his colleague visited the city, they were
mobbed and threatened, the people showing
the utmost hostility. But the day came, at
last, when the long-prayed-for permission
from the presbytery to open Changte was
granted. The very next morning found Mr.
Goforth <i>en route</i> for Changte, to secure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
property for a mission site. Often has he
told how, all the way over that day to Changte,
he prayed the Lord to open the hearts of
the people, and make them willing to give
him the property most suitable for the work.
Within three days of his reaching Changte
he had thirty-five offers of property, and was
able to secure the very piece of land he had
earlier chosen as most ideal for the mission.</p>

<p>Thus the Lord did break in pieces the gates
of brass which had kept us so long from our
promised land.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A year later I joined my husband there,
with our three little children. It was arranged
that our colleague should take charge of the
outside evangelism, while we opened work at
the main station.</p>

<p>To understand what it meant for us to
have our need supplied, there should be some
knowledge of what that need was.</p>

<p>We decided, from the first, that no one
should be turned from our doors. Mr. Goforth
received the men in the front guest room,
while the women and children came to
our private quarters. During those first
weeks and months hundreds, nay thousands,
crowded to see us. Day by day we were
literally besieged. Even at meal-time our
windows were banked with faces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The questions ever before us those days
were&mdash;how to make the most of this wonderful
opportunity, which would never come
again after the period of curiosity was past;
how to win the friendship of this people, who
showed in a hundred ways their hatred and
distrust of us; how to reach their hearts with
our wonderful message of a Saviour's love?</p>

<p>All that was in our power was to do, day
by day, what we could with the strength that
was given us. From early morning till dark,
sometimes nine or ten hours a day, the strain
of receiving and preaching to these crowds
was kept up. My husband had numbers of
workmen to oversee, material for building to
purchase, and to see to all the hundred and
one things so necessary in building up a new
station. Besides all this he had to receive,
and preach to, the crowds that came. He
had no evangelist, Mr. Wang being then
loaned to Mr. MacG&mdash;&mdash;. I had my three
little children, and no nurse or Bible-woman.
When too exhausted to speak longer to the
courtyard of women, I would send for my
husband, who though tired out would speak
in my stead. Then we would rest ourselves,
and entertain the crowd, by singing a hymn.</p>

<p>So the days passed. But we soon realized
that help must come, or we would both break
down.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>One day Mr. Goforth came to me with his
Bible open at the promise, "My God shall
supply all your need," and asked: "Do we
believe this? If we do, then God can and
will supply us with some one to help preach
to these crowds, if we ask in faith."</p>

<p>He prayed very definitely for a man to
preach. With my doubt-blinded heart, I
thought it was as if he were asking for rain
from a clear sky. Yet, even while he prayed,
God was moving one to come to us. A day
or two later there appeared at the mission the
converted opium fiend, Wang Fu-Lin, whose
conversion has been already recorded.</p>

<p>No one could have looked less like the answer
to our prayers than he did. Fearfully
emaciated from long years of excessive
opium smoking, racked with a cough which
three years later ended his life, dressed in
such filthy rags as only a beggar would wear,
he presented a pitiable sight. Yet the Lord
seeth not as man seeth.</p>

<p>After consulting together Mr. Goforth decided
to try him for a few days, believing
that he could at least testify to the power of
God to save a man from his opium. Soon he
was reclothed in some of my husband's Chinese
garments; and within an hour or two of
his entering the mission gate, practically a
beggar, he was seated in charge of the men's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
chapel, so changed one could scarcely have
recognized him.</p>

<p>From the first day of his ministry at
Changte there was no doubt in the minds of
any who heard him that he had indeed been
sent to us by our gracious God, for he had in
a remarkable degree the unction and power
of the Holy Ghost. His gifts as a speaker
were all consecrated to one object&mdash;the winning
of souls to Jesus Christ. He seemed
conscious that his days were few, and always
spoke as a dying man to dying men.
Little wonder is it, therefore, that from the
very beginning of his ministry in our chapel
men were won to Christ. God spared him to
us for the foundation laying of the church at
Changte, then called him higher.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mr. Goforth's need was relieved by the
coming of Wang Fu-Lin, but not mine. The
remarkable way God had sent him, however,
gave me courage and faith to trust God to
give me a Bible-woman. Those who know
anything of mission work in China will agree
with me that it is far more difficult to find
women than men who are able to preach the
Gospel; or if able, who are free for the work.
But I was beginning to learn that God is limited
only from the human side; and that he
is always willing to give beyond our asking,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
if the human conditions he has so plainly
laid down in his Word are fulfilled.</p>

<p>A short time after I had begun to ask my
Heavenly Father definitely for a Bible-woman,
Mr. Mac G&mdash;&mdash; came in from a
tour, and his first words were:</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Goforth, I believe we have a
ready-made Bible-woman for you!"</p>

<p>Then he told me how he had come across a
widow and her son in a mountain village, who
had heard the Gospel from a recent convert
out of one of the other stations. This man
had been a member of the same religious sect
as the widow and her son. When he found
Christ he at once thought of his friends, and
went over the mountain to tell them. Mrs.
Chang received the Gospel gladly. She had
been a preacher in that heathen sect, and had
gained the fluency in speaking, and power in
holding audiences, so necessary in the preaching
of the Gospel.</p>

<p>The way was soon opened for her to come
to me, and she became my constant companion
and valuable assistant in the women's
work during those early years. She witnessed
a good confession in 1900&mdash;being
strung up by her thumbs when refusing to
deny her Lord. Faithfully she served the
Lord as a Bible-woman, until the time of her
death in 1903.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>During the first two or three years at
Chang Te Fu we lived in unhealthy Chinese
houses, which were low and damp. It was
therefore thought best that we should have a
good semi-foreign house built for us. The
work at this time was so encouraging&mdash;converts
being added weekly, and sometimes
almost daily&mdash;that we feared lest the new
house would hinder the work, and become a
separating barrier between ourselves and the
people. We therefore prayed that God would
make the new house a means of reaching the
people&mdash;a blessing, and not a hindrance. The
answer to this prayer, as is often the case,
depended largely upon ourselves. We had to
be made willing to pay the price that the answer
demanded.</p>

<p>In other words, we came to see that in
order that our prayer could be answered we
would have to keep open house every day and
all day, which was by no means easy. Some
assured us it was wrong, because it would
make us cheap in the eyes of the Chinese;
others said it was wrong because of the danger
of infection to the children. But time
proved these objections to be unfounded.
The very highest as well as the lowest were
received, and their friendship won by this
means. And, so far as I can remember, our
children never met any contagion because of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
this way of receiving the people into our
house.</p>

<p>The climax in numbers was reached in the
spring of 1899, when eighteen hundred and
thirty-five men and several hundred women
were received by us in one day. These were
first preached to in large bands, and then led
through the house. We have seen evidences
of the good of this plan in all parts of our
field. It opened the hearts of the people
toward us, and helped us to live down suspicion
and distrust as nothing else could have
done.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In May of 1898 we started down to Tientsin
by houseboat, with our children, for a
much-needed rest and change. Cold, wet
weather soon set in. Twelve days later, as
we came in sight of Tientsin, with a bitter
north wind blowing, our eldest child went on
deck without his overcoat, in disobedience to
my orders. Shortly after the child came in
with a violent chill. That afternoon, when
we arrived in Tientsin, the doctors pronounced
the verdict&mdash;pneumonia.</p>

<p>The following day, shortly after noon, a
second doctor, who had been called in consultation,
met a friend on his way from our
boy's bedside and told her he did not think
the child could live till morning. I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
taken his temperature, and found it to be 106.
He was extremely restless, tossing in the
burning fever. Sitting down beside him,
with a cry to the Lord to help me, I said distinctly:
"P&mdash;&mdash;, you disobeyed me, and have
thus brought this illness upon yourself. I
forgive you; ask Jesus to forgive you, and
give yourself to him."</p>

<p>The child looked at me for a moment
steadily, then closed his eyes. I saw his lips
move for a moment; then quietly he sank into
a sound sleep. When he awoke, about dusk,
I took his temperature, and found it 101. By
the time the doctor returned it was normal,
and did not rise again. Although he had
been having hemorrhage from the lungs, this
ceased.</p>

<p>Is not Jesus Christ the same yesterday, to-day,
and forever? Why should we wonder,
therefore, at his healing touch in this age?
"According to your faith be it unto you."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>During those early pioneer years, when
laying the foundation of the Changte Church,
my own weak faith was often rebuked when
I saw the results of the simple, child-like faith
of our Chinese Christians. Some of those
answers to prayer were of such an extraordinary
character that, when told in the homeland,
even ministers expressed doubts as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
their genuineness. But, praise God, I know
they are true. Here are two concrete examples.</p>

<p>Li-ming, a warm-hearted, earnest evangelist,
owned land some miles north of Chang
Te Fu. On one occasion, when visiting the
place, he found the neighbors all busy placing
around their fields little sticks with tiny flags.
They believed this would keep the locusts
from eating their grain. All urged Li-ming
to do the same, and to worship the locust god,
or his grain would be destroyed. Li-ming
replied: "I worship the one only true God,
and I will pray him to keep my grain, that
you may know that he only is God."</p>

<p>The locusts came and ate on all sides of Li-ming's
grain, but did not touch his. When
Mr. Goforth heard this story he determined
to get further proof, so he visited the place
for himself, and inquired of Li-ming's heathen
neighbors what they knew of the matter.
One and all testified that, when the locusts
came, their grain was eaten and Li-ming's
was not.</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus once said, after a conflict
with unbelief and hypocrisy: "I thank thee,
O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because
thou hast hid these things from the
wise and prudent, and hast revealed them
unto babes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Our little Gracie became ill with a terribly
fatal disease, so common in malarious districts&mdash;enlarged
spleen. The doctors pronounced
her condition quite hopeless. One
day a Chinese Christian woman came in with
her little child, of about the same age as our
Gracie, and very ill with the same disease.
The poor mother was in great distress, for
the doctor had told her also that there was no
hope. She thought that if we would plead
with the doctor he could save her child. At
last Mr. Goforth pointed to our little Gracie,
saying: "Surely, if the doctor cannot save
our child, neither can he save yours; your
only hope and ours is in the Lord himself."</p>

<p>The mother was a poor, hard-working, ignorant
woman, but she had the simple faith
of a little child. Some few weeks later she
called again, and told me the following story:</p>

<p>"When the pastor told me my only hope
was in the Lord, I believed him. When I
reached home I called my husband, and together
we had committed our child into the
Lord's hands. I felt perfectly sure the child
would get well, so I did not take more care of
him than of a well child. In about two weeks
he seemed so perfectly well that I took him to
the doctor again, and the doctor said that he
could discover nothing the matter with him."</p>

<p>That Chinese child is now a grown-up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
healthy man. And <i>our child died</i>. Yet we
had prayed for her as few, perhaps, have
prayed for any child. Why, then, was she
not spared? I do not know. But I do know
that there was in my life, at that time, the sin
of bitterness toward another, and an unwillingness
to forgive a wrong. This was quite
sufficient to hinder any prayer, and did hinder
for years, until it was set right.</p>

<p>Does this case of unanswered prayer shake
my faith in God's willingness and power to
answer prayer? No, no! My own child
might just as reasonably decide never again
to come to me with a request because I have,
in my superior wisdom, denied a petition. Is
it not true, in our human relationships with
our children, that we see best to grant at one
time what we withhold at another? "What
I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt
know hereafter."</p>

<p>And one of the most precious experiences
of God's loving mercy came to me in connection
with our little Gracie's death. We had
been warned that the end would probably
come in convulsions; two of our dear children
had been so taken. Only a mother who
has gone through such an experience can
fully understand the horror of the possibility
that such might come again at any time.</p>

<p>One evening I was watching beside our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
little one, Miss P&mdash;&mdash; being with me, when
suddenly the child said very decidedly: "Call
Papa; I want to see Papa." I hesitated to
rouse her father, as it was his time to rest; so
I tried to put her off with some excuse; but
again she repeated her request, and so I called
her father, asking him to walk up and down
with her until I returned.</p>

<p>Going into the next room I cried in an
agony to the Lord not to let Gracie suffer;
but, if it was indeed his will to take the child,
then to do so without her suffering. As I
prayed a wonderful peace came over me, and
the promise came so clearly it was as if
spoken: "Before they call I will answer; and
while they are yet speaking I will hear."
Rising, I was met at the door by Miss P&mdash;&mdash;
who said: "Gracie is with Jesus." While I
was on my knees our beloved child, after resting
a few moments in her father's arms, had
looked into his face with one of her loveliest
smiles, and then quietly closed her eyes and
had ceased to breathe. No struggle, no pain,
but a "falling on sleep."</p>

<p>"Like as a father pitieth, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so the Lord
pitieth."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Ever-darkening clouds gathered about us
during the months following Gracie's death;
and while the storm did not burst in all its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fury till the early summer of 1900, yet the
preceding winter was full of forebodings and
constant alarms.</p>

<p>On one occasion thousands gathered inside
and outside our mission, evidently bent on
serious mischief. My husband and his colleagues
moved in and out all that day among
the dense crowd which filled the front courtyards;
while we women remained shut
within closed houses, not knowing what moment
the mob would break loose and destroy
us all. What kept them back that day?
What but trustful prayer! And the Lord
heard that day, and wonderfully restrained
the violence of our enemies.</p>

<p>We did not know then, but those experiences
were preparing us for the greater trials
and perils awaiting us all.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<h2>V</h2>

<h3>OUR DELIVERANCE FROM<br />
THE BOXERS (1900)</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"God is unto us a God of deliverances"
(Psa. 68:20, R. V.).</p>

<p>"Who delivered us out of so great a death,
and will deliver: on whom we have set our
hope that he will also still deliver" (2 Cor.
1:10, R. V.).</p></div>


<div class='cap'>MANY times we were asked in the homeland
to tell the story of our escape during
the Boxer uprising, and often the question
was put, "If it was really God's power
that saved you and others on that journey,
then why did he not save those of his children
who were so cruelly done to death?"</div>

<p>For a time this question troubled me.
Why indeed? One day when seeking for
light on the matter I was directed to the
twelfth chapter of Acts. There I found the
only answer that can be given. We are told
in the second verse that James was put to
death by the sword; then the rest of the chapter
is given to the detailed record of Peter's
wonderful deliverance in answer to prayer
(vs. 5, 12). In that day when all things
shall be revealed I am convinced we shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
see that <i>prayer</i> had much to do in the working
out of our deliverance. When the first
cable was received in Canada informing the
home church of our party starting on that
perilous journey, we are told a great wave
of prayer went up for us from Christians of
all denominations. The Presbyterian Assembly
of Canada was meeting at the time,
and one session was given up entirely to
prayer on behalf of the missionaries in China.
Never had that body witnessed such a season
of intense, united intercession.</p>

<p>Later when giving the story of our escape
in the homeland, repeatedly we have had
people come to us telling how, during the
weeks which elapsed between the first cable
informing the home church of our danger,
and the second cable, which told of our safe
arrival at the coast, they had never ceased to
cry to God to save us. Then, too, after
all is said, we must believe God was glorified
and God's purposes were fulfilled in the death
of some as in the saved lives of others. The
blood of the martyrs is still the seed of the
Church.</p>

<p>It was in the month of June, 1895, that an
incident occurred which has ever been linked
in my mind with the events of 1900. I was
about to leave Toronto with my four children
to join my husband in China, when a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
cable was received telling of the cruel massacre
of Mr. and Mrs. Stewart and others.
Deep and widespread sympathy was expressed
and much anxiety felt for missionaries
generally in China. Many urged me
to delay our return; but I felt it best to keep
to our original plans, and a few days later
found us bidding farewell to friends at the
Union Station, Toronto.</p>

<p>Just as the train was leaving a lady stepped
forward quickly to the window and said,
"You do not know me, but I have prayed
the Lord to give me a promise for you; it is
this, take it as from Him," and handed me a
slip of paper. I opened the paper and
read, "No weapon that is formed against
thee shall prosper" (Isa. 54:17). Then and
there I raised my heart to God in prayer that
he would fulfil this promise to me and those
dear to me; and as I prayed there came the
clear assurance that the Lord heard.</p>

<p>Never can we forget that winter of 1899-1900.
The clouds had begun to gather, and
the mutterings of the coming storm were
heard on all sides of us. Repeatedly we were
as a mission in gravest danger, and at such
times were literally "shut up to God." The
temper of the people was such that any little
thing angering them would have been as a
spark to gunpowder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>From the time of the government crisis
of the autumn of 1899, we, in company with
all other foreigners in China, realized that
conditions were becoming serious, yet never
did we expect or prepare for such a cataclysm
as took place when the storm clouds
suddenly burst in the early summer of 1900.</p>

<p>The first indication we had of coming
danger was when our mail carriers running
to and from Tientsin were stopped and our
mails returned. Thus, cut off from the outside
world, we had to depend solely upon the
wild rumors afloat among the Chinese for
information. The country around us became
daily more disturbed; day by day we could
hear the beating of drums and the cries of
the people for rain. The darkness and
horror of those days, in the midst of which
sickness and death entered our home, can
never be forgotten. On the nineteenth of
June our eldest daughter, Florence, after a
week of intense suffering, was released from
pain. It was while her life was still hanging
in the balance that we received the first
communication from the American Consul
in Chefoo urging us to flee. This message
was quickly followed by another still more
urgent.</p>

<p>The question was, where could we flee?
Our usual route was by river boat two weeks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to Tientsin, but this way was blocked, the
whole region being infested with Boxers,
and Tientsin even then in a state of siege.
The only possible route left open to us was
southward by cart,&mdash;fourteen days to Fan-cheng,&mdash;then
ten or more days by houseboat
to Hankow. We faced such a journey at
that time of the year with fear and trembling
because of the children, the danger
from heat and sun being very great. Gladly
would we have stayed, but the Chinese Christians
urged us to go, saying they could escape
more easily were we not there.</p>

<p>We had with us our four remaining children:
Paul, nine; Helen, six; Ruth, under
three; and baby Wallace, eight months.
Their faithful Chinese nurse, though weeping
bitterly at parting from her old mother
of almost eighty, decided to come with us.
There were altogether in the party five men,
six women, and five children, besides the
servants and carters.</p>

<p>Many were the difficulties in the way of
getting carts and other necessary things for
the journey, but one by one all things needed
were provided as we besought the Lord to
open the way. There were many indications
on that journey that God's purpose was to
save us; one of the most striking of these
happened just as we were about to leave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The day previous to our departure a message
passed through the city of Chang Te
Ho, the messenger riding at breakneck speed.
This messenger, we learned later, was en-route
for the Provincial Capital with the
sealed message from the Empress Dowager
commanding the death of all foreigners. We
had planned first to take the direct route
south, which would, as far as we can now
see, have led us to our death, for this route
would have taken us through the capital.
Almost at the last moment, and quite unaware
of the danger on the direct route,
we were led to change our plans and take a
route farther west, though it made a considerably
longer journey.</p>

<p>We left Chang Te, June 28, 1900, at daybreak.
At Wei Hwei Fu, the first large city
to which we came, an attempt was made to
break into our inn, but as we prayed the mob
dispersed and we were left in peace. On
July first we reached the north bank of the
Yellow River, and there for a short time (it
was Sunday afternoon) we rested under the
trees. Little did we dream that even then
many, very many, of our fellow-missionaries
and personal friends were being done to
death by the merciless Boxers. At sunset
the ferry which carried us across the river
reached the south bank, and here we found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
several missionaries and a party of engineers
waiting for us. These latter were fully
armed and had a fair escort. After some
difficulty it was decided that we should all
keep together, but in reality this party kept
by themselves, except that we stayed in the
same towns at night. Each day that passed
seemed harder than the last, the heat was
intense, and the ten or twelve hours of bumping
over rough roads in springless carts
made even a bed spread on the ground a
welcome resting-place.</p>

<p>Once, when Mr. Goforth had jumped off
our cart to get fresh water for our head
cloths, a crowd gathered round him and became
very threatening, raising the cry, "Kill,
kill." All the other carts were ahead, and
the carter would not wait for Mr. Goforth,
as he was afraid. During the few moments
that elapsed before my husband was allowed
to join us even the carter turned pale with
suspense,&mdash;and oh, how I prayed!</p>

<p>Except for a few similar passing dangers,
nothing special occurred until the evening
of July seventh, when we reached the small
town of Hsintien. We had heard during the
day that the whole country ahead of us was
in a state of ferment against the Roman
Catholics. Scarcely had we reached the inn
when the engineers and the missionaries with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
them who had become increasingly alarmed
at the condition of the country, informed us
that they were going on to the large city of
Nan Yang Fu that night, but would leave
us two soldiers and two of their carts. Mr.
Goforth did not wish them to go, for he felt
it would greatly increase our danger.</p>

<p>Shortly after they left us the mob began
to gather outside our inn. The gate was
barricaded with carts. For hours stones
were thrown against the gate and demand
was made for our money. A messenger was
at once sent after the engineers' party, asking
them to return. All that night was
spent in sleepless suspense.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the messenger returned
with the reply that they had failed to
get help from the Nan Yang Fu official and
were obliged to push on. As soon as the
carters heard we were thus left helpless a
panic seized them, and it was with great difficulty
they could be persuaded to harness their
animals. All this time the crowd had been
becoming more dense, as we could see
through the cracks of the gate, and were
ominously quiet. Hints had been given us
of coming danger, but that was all; none
spoke of what all felt,&mdash;that we were probably
going to our death.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without the slightest warning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
I was seized with an overwhelming fear of
what might be awaiting us. It was not the
fear of <i>after</i> death, but of probable torture,
that took such awful hold of me. I thought,
"Can this be the Christian courage I have
looked for?" I went by myself and prayed
for victory, but no help came. Just then
some one called us to a room for prayer before
getting into our carts. Scarcely able to
walk for trembling, and utterly ashamed
that others should see my state of panic,&mdash;for
such it undoubtedly was,&mdash;I managed
to reach a bench beside which my husband
stood. He drew from his pocket a little
book, "Clarke's Scripture Promises," and
read the verses his eye first fell upon. They
were the following:</p>

<p>"The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath
are the everlasting arms: and he shall
thrust out the enemy from before thee; and
shall say, Destroy them."</p>

<p>"The God of Jacob is our refuge."</p>

<p>"Thou art my help and my deliverer;
make no tarrying, O my God."</p>

<p>"I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help
thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right
hand of my righteousness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Lord thy
God will hold thy right hand, saying unto
thee, Fear not; I will help thee."</p>

<p>"If God be for us, who can be against us?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"We may boldly say, The Lord is my
helper, and I will not fear what man shall do
unto me."</p>

<p>The effect of these words at such a time
was remarkable. All realized that God was
speaking to us. Never was there a message
more directly given to mortal man from his
God than that message to us. From almost
the first verse my whole soul seemed flooded
with a great peace; all trace of panic vanished;
and I felt God's presence was with us.
Indeed, his presence was so real it could
scarcely have been more so had we seen a
visible form.</p>

<p>After prayer we all got on our carts, and
one by one passed out into the densely crowded
street. As we approached the city gate
we could see that the road was black with
crowds awaiting us. I had just remarked to
my husband on how well we were getting
through the crowds, when our carts passed
through the gates. My husband turned pale
as he pointed to a group of several hundred
men, fully armed, awaiting us. They waited
till all the carts had passed through the gate,
then hurled down upon us a shower of stones,
at the same time rushing forward and maiming
or killing some of the animals. Mr.
Goforth jumped down from our cart and
cried to them, "Take everything, but don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
kill." His only answer was a blow. The
confusion that followed was so great it would
be impossible to describe the escape of each
one in detail. Each one later had his or her
own testimony of that mighty and merciful
deliverance. But I must give the details of
Mr. Goforth's experience.</p>

<p>One man struck him a blow on the neck
with a great sword wielded with two hands.
"Somehow" the blunt edge of the sword
struck his neck; the blow left a wide mark
almost around his neck, but did no further
harm. Had the sharp edge struck his neck
he would certainly have been beheaded!</p>

<p>His thick helmet was cut almost to pieces,
one blow cutting through the leather lining
<i>just over the temple</i>, but without even
scratching the skin!</p>

<p>Again he was felled to the ground, with a
fearful sword cut, which entered the bone of
the skull behind and almost cleft it in two.
As he fell he seemed to hear distinctly a
voice saying, "Fear not, they are praying
for you." Rising from this blow, he was
again struck down by a club. As he was
falling almost unconscious to the ground he
saw a horse coming at full speed toward
him; when he became conscious again he
found the horse had tripped and fallen (on
level ground) so near that its tail almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
touched him. The animal, kicking furiously,
had served as a barrier between him and his
assailants. While dazed and not knowing
what to do a man came up as if to strike, but
whispered, "Leave the carts." By that time
the onlookers began to rush forward to get
the loot, but the attacking party felt the
things were theirs, so desisted in their attack
upon us in order to secure their booty.</p>

<p>A word as to myself and the children.
Several fierce men with swords jumped on
my cart. One struck at the baby, but I
parried the blow with a pillow, and the little
fellow only received a slight scratch on the
forehead. Then they dropped their swords
and began tearing at our goods at the back
of the cart. Heavy boxes were dragged over
us, and everything was taken. Just then a
dreadful looking man tried to reach us from
the back of the cart with his sword, missing
by an inch. I thought he would come to the
front and continue his attack, but he did not.
I had seen Mr. Goforth sink to the ground
covered with blood twice, and had given him
up for dead. Just then Paul, who had been
in the last cart, jumped in, wild with delight
at what he seemed to think was great fun,
for he had run through the thick of the fight,
dodging sword thrusts from all sides, and
had succeeded in reaching me without a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
scratch. A moment later my husband came
to the edge of the cart scarcely able to stand,
saying, "Get down quickly; we must not
delay in getting away." As I was getting
down one man snatched away my hat, another
my shoes; but we were allowed to go.</p>

<p>Ruth was nowhere to be seen, and we
hoped she was with the missionaries who had
charge of her at the time of attack. I saw
that Mr. Goforth's strength was failing fast,
for he could scarcely walk, and as men began
to follow I urged him forward with the baby
and the other two children, and turning faced
the men, begging them to have mercy on my
children, for they had begun to stone us.
Some of us were black for days from the
blows received then. They stopped and listened,
then the leader said, "We've killed her
husband, let her go." With this they ran
back to the carts.</p>

<p>I knew Mr. Goforth could not go far. We
could see a small village not far distant, and
to this we hastened, praying as we went that
the Lord would open the hearts of the people
to receive us. Here again Paul seemed to
feel no fear, but said, "Mother, what does
this put you in mind of? It puts me in mind
of the Henty books!"</p>

<p>As we neared the village men came out to
drive us away, but I begged them to help us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
By this time Mr. Goforth had sunk to the
ground. Putting the baby in an old woman's
arms, I knelt down beside my husband. The
children were crying bitterly. Mr. Goforth
looked as if he were dying. The women
standing round us were weeping now. This
was too much for the men, who came forward
saying, "We will save you." One ran
and got some stuff to put in the wounds, assuring
us it would stop the flow of blood, and
it did. This man helped me to bandage up
the wounds with bandages made from garments
taken from myself and the children.
They helped my husband, and we followed
them into a little hut, where they laid him on
a straw bed and locked us in. Hot water for
bathing our bruises, food and drink were
handed us through a small window, and we
could hear them planning how they would
save us. We told them how anxious we were
to hear of our friends and little Ruth, so they
sent a man to inquire.</p>

<p>We found that these people&mdash;the whole
village&mdash;were Mohammedans, and had taken
no part in the attack. We felt that God had
wonderfully directed our steps to that village.</p>

<p>All that day Mr. Goforth lay still, but
looked at times so very white that I feared
the worst. Never for one moment, I believe,
during that day did I cease to pray for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
life. And when Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, one of our party,
arrived about four o'clock looking for us, Mr.
Goforth at once got up as if perfectly well,
insisting on walking to the cart. To me,
knowing how he had looked that day, it
seemed only a miracle. His only answer to
my protest was, "Only pray; the Lord will
give me strength, as long as he has work for
me to do."</p>

<p>As we were leaving, the kind friends of the
village gathered round insisting on my taking
some old clothes to put round the children,
who were almost naked, saying, "It will
be chilly at night." As we went forward to
join the others, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; told us how one by
one all had escaped. Dr. &mdash;&mdash; was the only
one beside Mr. Goforth seriously injured, the
poor fellow having had his kneecap severed
and the tendons of his right wrist badly cut,
besides many other wounds.</p>

<p>All that day our friends had been waiting
by the roadside, unable to proceed without
carts, owing to the doctor's condition. They
had joined in one petition, that God would
move the carters to come. Those who know
China and heathen carters will readily acknowledge
that it was nothing short of a miracle&mdash;the
miracle of answered prayer&mdash;that
made these heathen carters come, after all
they had already gone through. For come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
they did, five of them, all that were needed,
now that our luggage was gone. We learned
too, that our faithful Chinese nurse, who
had charge of Ruth, had saved the child at
the risk of her own life, lying upon the child
and taking many cruel blows, till greed for
loot drew the men off.</p>

<p>We soon joined the rest of the party, and
by six o'clock that evening we reached the
large city of Nang Yang Fu. The city wall
was black with people, and as we entered the
gate the wild crowds crushed against our
carts. Sometimes the animals staggered, and
it seemed as if nothing could save the carts
from being overturned. Every moment or
two a brick or stone would be hurled against
the carts, and that cry, "Kill, kill," which can
never be forgotten when once heard, was
shouted by perhaps hundreds of voices. Yet
the Lord brought us through, and "no
weapon prospered."</p>

<p>When we reached the inn a wild mob of
over a thousand men filled the inn yard; and
as we alighted from the cart these men literally
drove us before them into one room,
which in a few moments was packed to suffocation.
For probably an hour the crowd
kept crushing us into one corner; then those
outside became impatient at not being able to
get in, and demanded that we be brought out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
We managed to keep some of the ladies from
going out; but the rest of us&mdash;men, women,
and children&mdash;stood facing that seething
multitude until relief came in the darkness.
Why did they not kill us then? Why, indeed?
None but an Almighty God kept that
crowd back.</p>

<p>As soon as we had reached the city a servant
was sent to the official demanding protection.
It was dark when this man returned,
in a state of great agitation; his story was
that as he was waiting for an answer from
the official he overheard a conversation between
two soldiers, and gathered from what
they said that the official had sent a party of
fifty soldiers along the road that we would
have to take, with the order that every one of
us must be put to death. The official was
afraid to have us killed in the city lest he
should afterward be blamed; but by this plan
he could say brigands had done the deed. So
sure was this servant that we were all to be
massacred that he would remain with us no
longer, but returned that night to Honan
with the report that we were all killed.</p>

<p>A consultation was held, and the question
was, should we stay in the city and again demand
protection, or should we go on and
trust God to open our way? The latter course
was decided upon. But for a long time the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
carters utterly refused to go farther with
us. Again prayer opened up our way, and
by two o'clock in the morning all were ready
to start.</p>

<p>The official had sent a few foot-soldiers to
guide us to <i>the right road</i>! (to the waylaying
party). The night was very dark, and as we
were passing through the gate of the city we
noticed what seemed to be signal lights put
out and drawn in. We all felt these to be
signals to the waylaying party ahead. A
short distance from the city, probably about
one hundred yards, our carts suddenly
stopped. Some one ran up and whispered to
Mr. Goforth, "Paul and Mr. &mdash;&mdash; are missing."
Search was made for them, but
without success.</p>

<p>A veil must be drawn over those terrible
hours of suspense; my faith seemed to fail
me, and I could only cry in my agony, "If
Paul is gone, can I ever trust God again?"
Then I remembered how marvelously God
had given me back my dear husband's life,
and I just committed Paul into his hands and
waited to see what he would do.</p>

<p>When all hope was given up of finding the
missing ones, a cart was left behind with a
trusted servant, and we went on. Then we
saw God's wonderful plan for us. While we
were waiting the soldiers had fallen asleep in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the carts, and were not aware that the carters
were taking a side road until we had gotten
miles from the city and beyond the reach of
our would-be murderers! The soldiers were
infuriated at this discovery; but after some
threatening they left us and returned to the
city. Thus again we saw that God was indeed
unto us a "God of deliverances."</p>

<p>Again and again that day we were surrounded
by mobs. Many times I held up the
poor, dirty clothes which the Mohammedans
had given us, and the story of how these had
been given quieted the people perhaps more
than anything. Once the cry was raised to
drag our children's nurse out of the cart; but
as we cried to God for her the people let us
alone, and we passed on. At another time a
man snatched the remains of Mr. Goforth's
helmet away from us, and tore it to pieces. I
had hoped to keep it as a trophy should we
ever get out safely.</p>

<p>We were at this time in a pitiable condition.
Most of the men had head or arms
bandaged; Dr. &mdash;&mdash; was unable to raise his
head. What we suffered in those carts with
nothing but the boards under us cannot be
told. Nine persons were packed in our cart,
which under ordinary circumstances would
have held four or five. At noon we reached
a large city, where the animals had to rest and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
feed. Then again we saw an evidence of the
Lord's loving kindness over us.</p>

<p>Just as we were getting down from our
carts the crowd became very threatening, and
it looked now as if our hour had indeed
come; but at this critical juncture two well-dressed
young men of official class came
through the crowd, greeting Mr. Goforth in
great surprise. They had been received by
him in our home at Chang Te Ho. A few
words of explanation were spoken, then they
turned quickly to the crowd and told them
who we were and of the work at Chang Te
Ho. The attitude of the people changed instantly,
and they made way for us, giving us
good rooms, and food was brought which
was greatly needed.</p>

<p>That noon, as one after another came up
to express their sympathy at Paul's loss, I
could say nothing&mdash;I was waiting to see
what God would do. When Mr. Goforth
told the young officials about Paul and Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,
they were greatly concerned, and
promised to send men at once to search for
them. These friends in need sent with us a
man of the district to guide and help us, and
also wrote an urgent letter to the official of
the city we were to stay in that night, asking
him to give us an escort and help us in every
way he could.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>About four o'clock that afternoon a man
came running after us with the joyful news
that Paul and Mr. &mdash;&mdash; were safe, and would
reach us that night. As I heard this news my
unbelief and faithlessness in the hour of testing
came over me with overwhelming force,
and I could only bow my head and weep. Oh,
the goodness and mercy of God! Never had
the love of God seemed so wonderful as in
that hour.</p>

<div class='poem'>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Though stretched from sky to sky."</span><br />
</div>

<p>That night we reached our destination
about nine o'clock, having traveled seventeen
hours over those roads, with but a short
break at noon. It was marvelous how Mr.
Goforth was sustained, for he was obliged to
start at once for the official's residence with
the note I have already referred to. On the
way through the street the mob about succeeded,
several times, in getting him down
under their feet; but God was with him, and
he reached the Yamen in safety, being courteously
received by the official, who promised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
us protection, and sent him back to the inn
under escort.</p>

<p>When Paul and Mr. &mdash;&mdash; arrived that
night, they tried in vain to wake me, but
nature had to have her way. I knew nothing
till I wakened with a start at about two A.M.
Jumping up, I started to look for Paul, and
never can I forget the scene! The whole
party was lying on the bare earthen floor,
practically without bedding or mattresses.</p>

<p>A word concerning the experiences of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
and Paul. The two had got down
from their cart and were walking behind. In
some way they missed the road in the dark,
and became separated from us. During that
day they were repeatedly in the gravest
danger.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when surrounded by a
violent mob, and one man had raised a club
above Paul's head to strike him down, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
felt impelled by some unseen power to
shout out, "We are not Roman Catholics,
but Protestants." At this the man lowered
his club, exclaiming, "Why, these are not the
bad foreign devils, but the good foreign
devils, like those missionaries at Chow Chia
K'eo" (China Inland Mission). At this same
place the hearts of the people seemed turned
toward them in a wonderful way. One man
gave Paul one hundred <i>cash</i> (five cents) to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
buy some food; another man carried the lad
on his back for miles to give his feet a rest,
they were so sore. This same man, when he
could carry Paul no longer, ran ahead to try
and find us. When they reached the inn
where we had been so helped by the two Chinese
gentlemen, they found that these friends
had food prepared and a barrow waiting, also
a guide ready to lead them to us!</p>

<p>Less than an hour from the time I awakened
we were on the road again. The official
was true to his promise, and a large mounted
escort accompanied us. That day we were
on the road twenty hours, reaching Fan
Cheng at midnight. Here we found the engineers'
party waiting for us with boats
hired, but we were obliged to remain twenty-four
hours in the most loathsome inn we ever
had the misfortune to be in in China. It was
an unspeakable relief to get into the houseboats,
even though we only had bare boards
to lie on, and the boat people's food to eat.</p>

<p>We were ten days going down stream to
Hankow. One after the other became ill.
When still a day from Hankow, a steam tug
met us with provisions. Our children cried
at the sight of bread and milk! We were not
allowed to stop long enough at Hankow, as
we had hoped, to get clothes and other necessaries,
but were obliged to hasten on by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
first steamer, which left the following morning.
I was obliged to borrow garments for
myself and the children from our fellow-passengers.</p>

<p>At Shanghai the streets were being paraded,
and every preparation was being made
for an attack. We learned with deep sorrow
of the death of many dear friends at the
hands of the Boxers. Ordered home by the
first steamer, without anything left to us but
the old clothes we had on at the time of the
attack, how could we get ready in such a
short time for the long home voyage? There
was no lack of money, for our Board had
cabled all we needed. The question that
faced us was how could I get clothes made
for six of us in such a short time, with Chinese
tailors too busy to help, no machine to
be had, and no ready-made clothes to be
bought except for Mr. Goforth and Paul.</p>

<p>Again I found that man's extremity was
but God's opportunity. He was true to his
promise, "God shall supply all your need."
Even as I knelt in an agony of prayer, beseeching
God's help, and asking definitely
that some one should be sent to me to help
with the sewing, two ladies were at the door
asking for me! These were perfect strangers,
but had seen our names among the recent
refugees, and God had moved them to come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and offer their assistance! They worked for
me night and day until we had to get on
board the steamer. Never shall I forget their
Christian fellowship and practical help at
that time.</p>

<p>But in the rush to get the older children
ready, baby Wallace's clothes were neglected.
There was nothing for it but to take materials
and make things for him on the voyage.
In this connection came a most wonderful
and precious evidence of God's power to answer
prayer. For the first few days of the
journey I worked early and late trying to
make something for the little one, who had
scarcely anything to wear; but as we were
nearing Yokohama I realized I had almost
reached the end of my strength. My needle
refused to work; try as I would I could not
even see where to put the needle.</p>

<p>Folding up my work I went down to the
stateroom, and kneeling down I spread the
work before the Lord. Too far gone to
agonize in prayer, I could only quietly, almost
mutely, just tell him how the poor child
had no clothes. Rising with a great sense of
the burden having been lifted, I put the work
away, locking it in a trunk, then went up on
deck and lay down almost insensible from exhaustion.
How long a time passed I do not
know, but it could not have been more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
half an hour when some one came and
touched me, saying, "We have dropped anchor
in Yokohama Bay, and a large bundle
has been thrown up on deck from the lighter
for you."</p>

<p>"For me!" I cried. "Surely not; I know
no one in Japan." Then I thought, "It is
the answer come!"</p>

<p>Going down I found a letter from Mrs.
O. E., of the China Inland Mission. She
said that her little son, the same age as baby
Wallace, had died four months before, and
the Lord had pressed her to send his complete
outfit to me for my child! Opening the
parcel, I found not only everything the child
could possibly need for a year or more, but
much else. Had some one stood beside that
dear sister and told her what I most needed,
she could not have done differently. Yes,
surely Some One did direct her loving hands,
and Some One just used her as one of his
channels; for she lived near to him, and was
an open channel.</p>

<p>Three days later my own collapse came;
but praise his great name, he was with me in
the darkness and brought me through.</p>

<h3>PROVING GOD'S FAITHFULNESS<br />
(1902-1908)</h3>

<div class="center">"The safest place .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is the path of duty."<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>ONE of the results of our gracious and
merciful deliverance from the hands of
the Boxers was an increased desire to make
our lives tell in the service of God&mdash;to
spend and be spent for him. Our Heavenly
Father saw this and just took us at our word,
and led us out into the path which meant absolute
surrender as I had never known it
before.</div>

<p>It is so true that "God will be no man's
debtor." When he asks for and receives our
all, he gives in return that which is above
price&mdash;his own presence. The price is not
great when compared with what he gives in
return; it is our blindness and our unwillingness
to yield that make it seem great.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The following story has been asked for
many times. Believing that it has a lesson
for others, I give it, though to do so means
lifting the veil from a very sacred part of my
life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>After the Boxer experience, my husband
returned to China in 1901; and, with my
children, I left for China in the summer
of 1902, leaving the two eldest children
at the Chefoo schools, <i>en route</i>
to Honan. Mr. Goforth met me at Tientsin,
and together we traveled by river-boat
inland a journey of about twenty-four
days. During those long, quiet days on the
river-boat my husband unfolded to me a
carefully thought out plan for future mission
work.</p>

<p>He reminded me that six missionaries,
from a mission-station which had been destroyed
by the Boxers, were now permanently
stationed at Changte; and that the
main station, now fully equipped, no longer
needed us as before. He felt that the time
had come when we should give ourselves to
the evangelization of the great regions north
and northeast of Changte&mdash;regions which
up to that time had been scarcely touched by
the Gospel, because of lack of workers. His
plan was that we&mdash;husband and wife, with
our children&mdash;should go and live and work
among the people.</p>

<p>To make this possible a native compound
would be rented in the center, where we
would stay a month for our first visit, leaving
behind an evangelist to carry on the work;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and we would revisit this and other places so
opened as many times as possible in the year.</p>

<p>What this proposition meant to me can
scarcely be understood by those unfamiliar
with China and Chinese life. Smallpox,
diphtheria, scarlet fever, and other contagious
diseases are chronic epidemics; and
China, outside the parts ruled by foreigners,
is absolutely devoid of sanitation.</p>

<p>Four of our children had died. To take
the three little ones, then with me, into such
conditions and danger seemed literally like
stepping with them over a precipice in the
dark and expecting to be kept. But, on the
other hand, I had the language and experience
for just such work, the need was truly
appalling, and there was no other woman to
do it. In my innermost soul I knew the call
had come from God, but I would not pay the
price. My one plea in refusing to enter that
life was the risk to the children.</p>

<p>Again and again my husband urged that
"the safest place" for myself and the children
"was the path of duty"; that I could not keep
them in our comfortable home at Changte,
but "God could keep them anywhere." Still
I refused. Just before reaching our station
he begged me to reconsider my decision.
When I gave a final refusal, his only answer
was: "I fear for the children."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The very day after reaching home our dear
Wallace was taken ill. For weeks we fought
for his life; at last the crisis passed and he
began to recover. Then my husband started
off alone on his first trip! He had been gone
only a day or two when our precious baby
Constance, a year old, was taken down with
the same disease that Wallace had. From the
first there seemed little or no hope. The
doctors, a nurse, and all the little mission
circle joined in the fight for her life. Her
father was sent for, but arrived just as she
was losing consciousness. A few hours later,
when we were kneeling round her bedside
waiting for the end, my eyes seemed suddenly
opened to what I had been doing&mdash;<i>I
had dared to fight against Almighty God</i>.</p>

<p>In the moments that followed God revealed
himself to me in such love and majesty and
glory that I gave myself up to him with unspeakable
joy. Then I knew that I had been
making an awful mistake, and that I could
indeed safely trust my children to him wherever
he might lead. One thing only seemed
plain, that I must follow where God should
lead. I saw at last that God must come first.
Before the precious body was laid away preparations
for our first trip were begun.</p>

<p>Was God faithful to the vision he had
given me? Or did he allow the children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to suffer in the years that followed, when
months each year were spent with them
right out among the people? As I write
this, eighteen years have passed since we
started on that first trip, and none of our children
have died. Never had we as little sickness
as during that life. Never had we so
much evidence of God's favor and blessing in
a hundred ways&mdash;as may be gathered from
the definite testimonies which follow.</p>

<p>Without one exception, every place in
which we stayed for a month, and opened as
my husband had planned, became in time a
growing church.</p>

<p>And I found, to my surprise, that I was
able to give more time to the children, that I
was able to guard them better when on those
trips than when in the Changte Station. For
the mission compound was large, and often
the children were out of my sight for hours
at a time; whereas the outside native compounds
we lived in were so small the children
were always within sight and reach. Even
when groups of women were listening to the
Gospel, I was able to direct the children's
lessons. As I look back on that time, my
heart is filled with overflowing gratitude to
God for the wonderful grace and strength he
gave for that life.</p>

<p>My great regret is that I did not keep a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
record of answers to prayer. I find it most
difficult to record just what "asking and getting
things from God" meant at that time,
but it now seems to me to have been the very
foundation of the whole life. The instances
of answers to prayer, here recorded, are simply
the ones connected with that life which
stand out most clearly in my memory of
those years.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The first answer came the morning after
our dear Constance died, and was the one
that had the greatest, most far-reaching effect
on the new life and its work.</p>

<p>As I thought of facing the crowds of
heathen women day by day, and what it
would mean to carry on aggressive evangelism
outside, there was one need I felt must be
met&mdash;that of a Bible-woman. As I prayed
for direction, a Mrs. Wang Hsieh-sheng
came to mind as the one I should ask.</p>

<p>But when I laid my request before her,
that she come with me, she burst into tears,
saying: "I dare not. I have only one child
left, and it would risk her life too much."</p>

<p>Seeing how she felt, I did not urge her, but
told her to go and pray about it for a day,
and bring me her answer after the funeral
that night. When she came that evening
her face was shining through tears, as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
said: "O my Shepherd Mother, I will go. If
you are willing to risk your children for
the sake of my sisters, how much more
should I!"</p>

<p>Eighteen years have passed since that day.
I would need to write a volume to record all
that Mrs. Wang meant to me in those years;
yes, and to the work. As the years passed
she became my beloved companion, sharing
in all the responsibilities and hardships of
that life, and also in its joys. I realized more
and more that she was indeed a God-given
co-worker. Though circumstances have led
me away from that life, she still remains and
works for her sisters in the Changte Church.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>One of the hardest words a missionary can
get from his Home Board is the word "retrench."
My husband and I were on one of
our evangelistic tours north of Changte.
Every door seemed wide open before us, and
the time ripe for a specially aggressive campaign
of evangelism for the heathen. But,
just as we were planning for this, word
reached us from our station treasurer of a
message received from the Home Board that
funds were low, and retrenchment must be
carried out along all lines.</p>

<p>To us this meant dismissing helpers, and a
general curtailing of our work. We faced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the question squarely. Our own tithe had
been long overdrawn. How then could we
support the men we had, and go on with the
work which was opening so gloriously before
us after years of hard pioneer preparation?</p>

<p>But we decided to go on as we had planned,
and to trust God for the necessary funds;
believing that, though for the time being the
home church had disappointed us, God would
not fail us.</p>

<p>The following Friday a home mail reached
us, in which was a letter from a lady in New
Zealand. The writer said she had read a
letter of ours in The Life of Faith, and
wished to support an evangelist under us.
This relieved us of the support of one man,
but there were many other needs as yet
unmet.</p>

<p>The following Monday, when our next
mail was forwarded to us, a letter came from
a lady in Australia, enclosing a draft ample
to meet every special need in the work for a
year to come. She stated very plainly that
she did not wish the money put into the
general funds of the mission, but to be used
by ourselves in any way we thought best. Indeed,
had she known the special circumstances
in which the letter would find us, she
could scarcely have written more exactly to
fit our case.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, a year after this experience of
God's faithfulness to meet all our needs, we
began to feel the need of special funds for
the work. My husband, as usual, seemed
quite sure that we should keep on as we had
been doing, and that the money needed would
be sent. In spite of all the blessed lessons of
the past, my faith seemed to fail me; and I
spoke decidedly against using our salary,
when we needed it all for ourselves and our
children's education. We were traveling
homeward by cart at the time and the matter
was dropped; though I felt my husband was
hurt by my lack of faith.</p>

<p>When we reached home, that evening, a
letter from a lady in Canada was awaiting
my husband. He read it first; and I cannot
forget the look on his face as he handed it to
me, with the words "I told you so."</p>

<p>As near as I can recall it the letter said:
"My mother and I are strangers to you, never
having seen or heard either you or your wife.
But my mother, who is an invalid, has for
some time been restless because of a conviction
that has come over her that she should
send you some money. So to quiet my
mother I am sending you fifty dollars."</p>

<p>As I read the letter, I certainly did feel
ashamed of my lack of faith. In writing our
acknowledgment, I told how wonderfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
opportune the gift had been. A couple of
months or so later came a reply, telling us
that the invalid mother passed away soon
after my letter reached them; and that the
story of how God had used her in this matter
greatly strengthened her faith, blessing and
helping her during the closing days of her
life.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On one occasion, when we were traveling
from Wuanhsien to Pengcheng, we reached
the town of Hotsun late in the afternoon, expecting
to stay over night. But on our
arrival we found that the Christian whom
we had sent to arrange for our accommodation
had failed to get us a place, every one
absolutely refusing to take us in. While the
animals were feeding, and we were trying to
eat our dinner of Chinese dough-strings in
the midst of a curious crowd, my husband
told the Christian to go out again and look
for a place while we prayed.</p>

<p>We dared not close our eyes, lest the superstitious
heathen crowd crushing against us
on all sides would take fright, thinking we
were mesmerizing them. So we just lifted
up our hearts silently to our Father; and before
many minutes had passed, indeed before
we had finished our meal, the Christian returned
greatly rejoiced, saying: "A wealthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
man has offered you a fine empty place which
has just been fixed over. And you can have
it as long as you like, free of rent."</p>

<p>For three days we preached in that place&mdash;morning,
noon, and night&mdash;to great crowds;
and a work was begun which has gone on
ever since.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There were times when my faith was severely
tested, and I fear too often I did not
stand the test; but oh, how patient God is
with us in our human weakness. "Like as a
father pitieth, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so the Lord pitieth." The
Chinese have often said to me, "Your children
seem made for this life." But I know
it was God's great goodness. He knew how
hard the life was, and how difficult it would
have been for me to continue that work had
the children been peevish or hard to manage.
Time and time again we had to get the little
ones up before daybreak to start on a cart
journey, but I do not remember that they
ever even cried. They would just wake up
enough to get dressed and ask sleepily, "Are
we going again, Mama?" and then go off to
sleep as soon as we were settled in our carts.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On one occasion, arriving at a certain
town, we found the place in which we were
to stay unfit for the children. It was simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
horrible. On either side of us, almost reaching
to our door, were two great pigstys&mdash;Chinese
pigstys! In front of the door were
eight or ten great vessels, filled with fermenting
stuff which had been there all summer,
and which added to the other varied and
oppressive odors. I greatly feared for the
children, and wanted to leave at once, but my
husband seemed calmly certain of the Lord's
power to keep them from all harm.</p>

<p>On the second evening the youngest child
became very feverish. Mr. Goforth was
holding a meeting with the men. I was
almost overwhelmed with fear lest the child
had diphtheria. Kneeling down beside him,
I cried to the Lord as only a mother under
like circumstances could pray. At last, tired
out, I fell asleep on my knees. Awakened
by the entrance of my husband, I felt the
child's head again and it seemed cooler, and
the child quieter. The following day he was
quite well. Is it much wonder I can say I
know God answers prayer?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Returning from our summer holiday the
first of September, 1912, we hoped to find a
place rented at a certain large center where
we had planned to begin work; but to our
disappointment learned that the evangelists
had secured premises in a small market village,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
where there was just one Christian.
There was nothing to do but to go there,
though it seemed almost useless, for it was
the busiest season for those farming people.</p>

<p>On our way to this place we prayed much
that the Lord would prepare the people, and
open their hearts to the Gospel. We had
not been there many days when we became
convinced that we had been led there, and
that the Lord was opening the hearts of the
people in a most unusual way. Crowds of
men and women heard the preaching every
day. Our evening Gospel meetings, with
organ and hymn scroll, were crowded out on
to the street.</p>

<p>Everywhere we met with the utmost
friendliness, and before our month's visit
was ended we had the joy of seeing some of
the leading people in the village and district
come out boldly for Christ. One was the
chief doctor; another was the head man in
the market. In the store, through which we
women had to pass to get to the evening
meeting, there were three men and a young
lad of fifteen; all of these were brought to
Christ. The men were opium users, gamblers,
men of evil lives. Two of them are
now preachers of the Gospel, and one is the
leading man in the little growing church
there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Had I time and space I could go on multiplying
cases where the same results have followed
when the cross of Christ has been the
pivot of all Christian teaching, and prayer
has been the source of power.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On one of the early visits to the city of
Linchang, a woman came with a little child
whose foot was terribly burned. The whole
foot was badly swollen, the inflammation
reaching some distance up the leg. The child
was feverish, and seemed in a serious condition.
It happened that on that trip I had
forgotten to bring the simple remedies which
I was accustomed to take out with me, so
the woman was told nothing could be done.
But she begged so piteously that I could not
turn away; and lifting up my heart in prayer
I asked the Lord to guide me, if there was
anything I could do.</p>

<p>Even while I prayed the thought of a
bread poultice came to mind. This remedy
seemed almost absurd. I had never heard of
such a thing being used before under like circumstances,
but I resolved to try it. Twice
a day the foot was cleansed and put in the
poultice, and it was really wonderful to see
how it healed. We were there ten days, and
when we left the foot was almost completely
well. The mother, father, the child herself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and indeed the whole family, became Christians.
On a later visit I examined the foot,
and found not even the sign of a scar remaining.</p>

<p>I told this incident not long ago to a medical
doctor, and he said: "Why, there is no
miracle in <i>that</i>! It was just up-to-date hygiene&mdash;giving
nature a chance by cleanliness!"</p>

<p>I replied: "Doctor, to me the miracle lay,
not in the poultice, but in God's telling me
what to use; and now it is to me all the more
a miracle of prayer, since you say it was up-to-date
hygienic treatment."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At the same place, some years later, we
were conducting special tent meetings for
Christians in the day time, and for the heathen
at night. Just after our meetings began
the weather turned bitterly cold, with wind
and sleety rain. The tent was like a drafty
ice-house. My husband caught a severe cold,
which became worse each day. He had fever
and severe pains in head and chest, but would
not give up his meetings. One noon he
came from the meeting looking very ill, and
lay down to rest till the afternoon meeting.</p>

<p>I determined to take the Christians into my
confidence, and tell them of my anxiety for
Mr. Goforth. So, some time before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
afternoon meeting I slipped out and called
them into the tent, telling them of my husband's
condition and asking them to pray for
him. Oh, what a wave of earnest, heart-overflow
of prayer went up without a moment's
pause! The tears came to my eyes as
I thought, "Surely God will answer such
prayers!"</p>

<p>Then, fearing my husband might arrive, I
gave out a hymn. A few moments later he
walked into the tent in his old brisk way,
looking quite well. At the close of the meeting
he told me that shortly after he heard me
go out the pain in his head and chest ceased,
the fever seemed to leave him, and when he
started for the tent he felt quite well. The
symptoms did not return.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When on a visit to a certain out-station,
after being there two whole days, scarcely
any women had come to see us. We were
so circumstanced that I could not leave the
children. The third day I became so burdened
in prayer that I could only shut myself
up in an empty room and cry to the Lord to
send women to us, as he knew I could not
leave the children. From that day we always
had plenty of visitors to keep us busy, either
Christian women studying or heathen women
listening to the Gospel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>At Tzuchow, the first place we opened together,
the people seemed much set against
us. After the first period of curiosity was
over, no one came to hear the Gospel. As we
had a nice place for the children to play in
with their faithful nurse,&mdash;the one who
saved Ruth's life in 1900,&mdash;Mrs. Wang and
I determined to go out each afternoon and
try to reach the heathen women with the Gospel.
Before going out we always prayed the
Lord to open a door to us for preaching.
And as I now recall that time, never once did
we return home without being invited into
some home to preach, or at least being asked
to sit on a doorstep and tell of a Saviour
from sin.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>One of the most outstanding evidences of
God's favor and blessing was seen, at this
time, in the way he provided my husband
with native helpers. To carry on the plan of
work we had adopted required a good force
of trusty evangelists. Time and again we
looked to the Lord for men and women to
help us, and the answer always came.</p>

<p>As my husband always seemed to have
plenty of men to help him, he was frequently
asked for evangelists by his fellow-missionaries
of both our own and other missions. I
was at first opposed to his giving away his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
best men, but he would answer, "The Lord
has been good to me; should I be less generous
with my brethren?" And it certainly
was remarkable how, whenever he gave a
really valuable evangelist, another man, even
better, was raised up shortly after. The
secret of his getting men may be seen best
through words of his own, taken from a
letter to a friend in Canada about the time
of which I am now writing:</p>

<p>"We came to this little market town in
September of last year. My wife had two
women workers. I had Mr. Tung, the old
evangelist, and a young high school graduate
without experience, and the only Christian
man in the district, very ignorant but with
this to recommend him, that he was converted
or quickened by the Holy Spirit in the
Changte revival, and was intensely in earnest.
We were here only about twenty days when
dozens began to inquire, among whom were
robbers, opium sots, and gamblers. The work
went on all day and well on till midnight. We
were all tiring out. We had not enough workers.
It was like a very heavy burden that
forced me to my knees. I told the Lord that
he was the Lord of the harvest, and that he
must send more harvesters. There was a
time of intense looking to God, almost
amounting to agony, and then the burden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
lifted, and I knew that God had answered.
I told my wife that I was sure that God was
going to send me workers.</p>

<p>"Now what is the result? Since then he
has sent me two Chinese B.A.'s, both excellent
speakers. He moved an excellent elder
to give up his business, and he has been appointed
an evangelist. At this center a
scholar, who was an opium user and gambler,
got converted last year. His progress has
been most remarkable, and it looks as if he
is going to make one of the front-rank
preachers. Also two brothers here, who were
among the first converts last year, help to
preach, their father&mdash;also a convert of last
year&mdash;providing their food."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Another gracious evidence of God's over-ruling
providence was seen in the way we,
especially the children, were kept from contracting
contagious diseases. The Chinese
carry their children about everywhere in
their arms, even when sick with all sorts of
contagious diseases.</p>

<p>I give the following instance to show how
impossible it was to know when one would
run into danger. Going to a certain village for
a day's preaching, I took with me little Mary,
then three years of age. We were waited on
by a Christian woman who was most kind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and attentive, bringing water and food for
both Mary and myself. Being much taken
up with preaching to the women, it did not
occur to me to ask why she kept her baby's
face covered, for the child was always in her
arms. Just as we were leaving I asked her;
then she uncovered the baby's face, and to
my horror I found that the child was suffering
from smallpox! For weeks I watched
Mary's temperature, but nothing developed.</p>

<p>Through repeated instances of this kind I
came to see that Mr. Goforth was right when
he said, "The safest place for yourself and
the children is in the path of duty."</p>

<p>As I recall those years of touring life with
our children, words fail me to tell of all the
Lord's goodness to them and to me. Though
there were many hard, hard places, these were
but opportunities for special grace and help.
Many times, when discouraged almost to the
point of never going out again with the children,
there would come evidence that the
Lord was using our family life, lived among
the people, to win them to Christ. Then I
would take new courage, and go again. Oh,
it is so true that</p>

<h3>THE STORY OF ONE FURLOUGH<br />
(1908-1910)</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Call upon me in the day of trouble: I
will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me"
(Psa. 50:15).</p></div>


<div class='cap'>IN THE summer of 1908 I was obliged to
return to Canada with five of our children,
leaving Mr. Goforth in China for the revival
work.</div>

<p>Reaching Toronto, I learned that my eldest
son was at death's door from repeated attacks
of rheumatic fever. He was then
almost a day's journey away. On my way
there, as I recalled the times in which he had
been given back to us from the very gates of
death, my faith was strengthened to believe
for his recovery again. But, as I prayed, it
became very clear that the answer to my petition
depended on myself; in other words,
that I must yield myself and my will to God.</p>

<p>I had been planning to take no meetings
during that furlough, but to devote myself
wholly to my children. I confessed the sin
of planning my own life, and definitely covenanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
with the Lord that if he would raise
my son for his service I would take meetings,
or do anything, as he opened the way for the
care of the children.</p>

<p>There were six difficult doors, however,
that would have to be opened&mdash;not one, but
all&mdash;before I could possibly go out and
speak for Christ and China, as God seemed
to be asking. First, the Lord would need to
restore my son to complete health, as I could
never feel justified in leaving a sick child.
Second, he would need to restore my own
health, for I had been ordered to the hospital
for an operation. Third, he would need to
keep all the other children well. Fourth, a
servant must be sent to take care of the house&mdash;though
my income was so small that a
servant seemed out of the question, and only
the strictest economy was making both ends
meet. Fifth, a Christian lady would need to
be willing to take care of the children, and
act as my housekeeper in my absence from
home. Sixth, sufficient money would need
to be sent to meet the extra expenses incurred
by my leaving home.</p>

<p>Yet, as I laid these difficulties before the
Lord, I received the definite assurance that he
would open the way.</p>

<p>My son was brought back to Toronto on a
stretcher, the doctor not allowing him to raise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
his head; but on arrival he would not obey
orders, declaring that he was so well he could
not and would not remain still. Fearing the
consequences of his disobeying orders, I telephoned
for the doctor to come at once. On
his arrival he gave the lad a thorough examination,
and then said: "Well, I cannot make
him out; all I can say is, let him do as he
pleases."</p>

<p>Within a month the boy was going back
to his high school, apparently quite well.
Some months later he applied for a position
as forester under the government. He had
to pass through the hands of the official doctor.
My son told him of his recent illness,
and of what the doctor had said concerning
his heart; but this physician replied: "In spite
of all you have told me I can discover nothing
whatever the matter with you, and will therefore
give you a clear bill of health."</p>

<p>As for myself, I did not go to the hospital;
for all the symptoms that had seemed to require
it left me, and I became perfectly well.
A servant was sent to me who did her work
sympathetically, as helping me to do the
Lord's work. A married niece, living near,
offered to stay in the home whenever I needed
to be absent.</p>

<p>And so there remained but one condition
unfulfilled&mdash;the money. But I believed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
this would come as I went forward; and it
did. Each month that followed, as I made
up my accounts, I found that my receipts exceeded
my expenditures sufficiently to enable
me to spend money for work in China, and to
purchase things which I needed for China,
including an organ. All these accounts were
laid before our beloved Mission Board secretary,
who approved them.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances I dared not
refuse invitations to speak. Yet, so weak
was my faith, for months I never left home
for a few days without dreading lest something
should happen to the children during
my absence. I even accepted meetings with
the proviso that if the children needed me I
must fail to keep my appointment. But as
the days and weeks and months passed, and
all went well, I learned to trust.</p>

</div>

<p>In giving the following I wish to make
clear that, had I been living a life of ease or
self-indulgence, I could not have been justified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in expecting God to undertake for me in
such matters as are here recorded. It must
be remembered that I had stepped out into a
life which meant <i>trusting for everything</i>.</p>

<p>Before leaving China for Canada my husband
had said to me: "Do not stint the children
with apples; give them all they want."
But when I began housekeeping I found this
was not very easy to do. Apples were expensive,
and the appetites of my six children
for them seemed insatiable. However, I
began by buying a few small baskets; and
then I did not need to buy more, for apples
came in a most wonderful way. First in
baskets; then, as the season advanced, in barrels.
These came from many different
sources; and in some cases long distances,
express paid to the door. On one occasion a
barrel of large, hard "Greenings" came just
as we had finished the last barrel. The children
complained that they were too hard to
eat, and begged me to buy them some
"Snows"&mdash;very expensive, but delicious
apples for eating. I had only purchased one
small basket of "Snows" when a large supply,
almost a barrelful, came from a distant
friend.</p>

<p>I feel that the Lord saw that I had given
up all for him, so just showed how he could
provide, thus evidencing his love and care for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
my dear children. We had set up housekeeping
at the end of the fruit season, and so
I had not been able to do canning for winter
use. That winter, again and again, gifts of
canned fruit came, sometimes from unknown
sources. Altogether, seventy jars of the
finest fruit were sent to us. I will give the
details of just one of these gifts.</p>

<p>Shortly before leaving home for ten days,
the servant informed me that the canned
fruit was finished. Accordingly, I went down
and ordered enough dried fruit to last till I
should return. On reaching home I was
greeted at the door by a rush from the children,
all trying at once to tell me that a
lovely valentine had just arrived. Leading
me back to the kitchen, they showed me the
table covered with twenty jars of the most
delicious looking fruit, and a large can of
maple syrup. On a card accompanying the
gift was written: "A valentine for our dear
'substitute in China,' from her sisters in
Renfrew."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Early in the winter it became evident that
a telephone was a necessity, with my numerous
calls and engagements. I hesitated about
going into this expense, not being quite sure
that it was right to use in that way the money
given me. At last, I prayed that the Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
would show me his will in the matter by sending
me half the amount needed for the telephone
within a certain time, if it was right
for me to get it. Before the time expired the
money had come; so I got the telephone.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>As the weather became cold I began to
suffer on the long drives in the country to
appointments, and was soon longing for a
fur coat. I consulted our mission secretary
as to whether, if sufficient money were given
me, I could put it into a fur coat. The answer
was a decided "Yes." There was no doubt
that the coat was a necessity in the Lord's
work. So I began to pray the Lord to send
the money quickly, for the cold was severe.
In less than two weeks I received the money
needed, and of course got the coat.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The ladies of the Winnipeg Presbyterial
had arranged a series of meetings for me
in Winnipeg, Brandon, and other places in
that vicinity, about ten in all. The collections
from the meetings were to defray my
traveling expenses, which would amount to
over one hundred dollars. On my way by
train from Toronto to Winnipeg I caught a
severe cold, which settled in my throat and
chest. I did not want the women to be disappointed,
and also put to all the expense, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
I failed them. Just before reaching Winnipeg
I was enabled to commit myself definitely
into the Lord's hands, for strength and
voice for the meetings. The days that followed
can never be forgotten, for the bodily
weakness, fever, and throat trouble were removed
only while I was giving my addresses.
In each case, though so hoarse before and
after speaking as to be scarcely able to make
myself heard above a whisper, my voice
cleared for the address.</p>

<p>For example: while at Dr. and Mrs. C. W.
Gordon's home the Sunday I was to speak in
Winnipeg, I was advertised to speak that
night in Dr. Gordon's church. At the supper
table I asked Dr. Gordon if he would be
ready to speak should I fail. Just before my
time came to speak I slipped up on to the
platform behind Dr. Gordon, who was praying;
and oh, how I cried to the Lord for help
and courage! For the church was packed,
and even the Sunday-school room partitions
were opened to accommodate the crowd. My
throat was as if in a vise, and I felt weak and
ill. But, as Dr. Gordon introduced me, I
stepped forward possessed by a feeling of
wonderful calm and absolute confidence. It
seemed I could just <i>feel</i> One like unto the
Son of man beside me, and never had I felt so
completely and only a channel. For more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
than an hour I spoke so that every one heard
distinctly; but when I sat down my throat
tightened as before. Dr. Gordon told me
later that he had a man sit in the most difficult
place in which to hear, and that he had
heard every word.</p>

<p>So it was till the end of my appointments.
On the homeward journey I asked the Lord
either to heal my throat, or to provide a way
for me to get a needed rest from speaking,
for I had many appointments awaiting me in
Ontario. A few days after reaching home
four of my children were taken down with
measles. During the weeks I was in quarantine
with them my throat received the rest it
needed, and became quite restored.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>One day the following early summer, in
looking over the children's clothes, I found
there was so much to be done I was fairly
overwhelmed. I saw it was quite impossible
to do the necessary sewing and keep my appointments
too. The question that weighed
heavily was, "Should I cancel the meetings
for which I had given my word?" My husband
urged me to buy ready-made clothes,
but I knew how expensive they would be, and
could not bring myself to do so. I went alone
and laid my burden before the Lord, praying
that, if he wanted me to speak further for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
China, he would show his will by sending me
some gift that would enable me to get ready-made
clothes for the children.</p>

<p>A few days later I was speaking at a Presbyterial
gathering in western Ontario. At
the close of the evening meeting an old gentleman
put into my hands some money. I
asked him what he wished me to use it for,
and he replied, "For your children. Use it
in a way that will help you to be free for
God's work." My heart rose in thanksgiving,
and I decided to accept it as the
token I had asked of the Lord. On my
return to Toronto I spent this gift in buying
ready-made clothes for the children, to
save my time and strength for the Lord's
work.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When busy in my home one day, the
thought of two dear friends of the China
Inland Mission kept coming constantly to
mind, and I began to wonder if I should not
send them some money. Looking into my
purse, I found I had only fifty cents on hand.
I put the matter out of my mind, with the
thought that if the Lord wanted me to send
them anything he would provide a way. That
afternoon's mail brought a letter from a distant
place in Ontario where, a year before, I
had visited and spoken for a friend. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
letter was from the treasurer of the Christian
Endeavor Society for which I had spoken.
He enclosed five dollars, and said the money
was to have been given me at the time I spoke
for them, but had been overlooked.</p>

<p>My first thought was to return it, as it
would be dishonoring my friend to accept
money for such a service; and then I remembered
my friends for whom I wanted money,
and I decided to send the five dollars to them.
My husband, returning the following morning,
handed me another five to put with it,
and the ten dollars was sent off.</p>

<p>In due course a reply came from my
friends, saying that the very morning my
letter arrived they both had been given assurance
that a certain sum would come, for
which they had been praying. This was to
meet a need which they did not wish to bring
before their Board. My letter brought the ten
dollars; and another letter in the afternoon's
mail contained a sum which, with mine, exactly
made the amount they had been asking
the Lord for.</p>

</div>

<p>On one occasion, when about to leave home
on a ten days' trip to Montreal and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
places, word came that the children's Sunday-school
treat was to take place during my
absence.</p>

<p>Little Mary had no "best" dress for the
occasion. I had planned to make her a white
woolen dress, but now there was no time; and
I knew I could not make it while away, with
so many meetings ahead. But, that very day,
a lady from our church called and said she
had wanted for a long time to help me, and
asked if she could do any sewing for me.
With dim eyes and a grateful heart I accepted
her offer. On my return, Mary told me of
her wearing a pretty white cloth dress for the
Sunday-school treat.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Once more we planned to leave Canada for
China, and a serious problem faced me. Our
eldest son could be left to face the world
alone, but not our daughter of sixteen. It
was necessary that a suitable guardian be
found for her. I called on three different
ones whom I thought would feel some responsibility
toward the missionary's daughter,
but all three declined to accept the responsibility.
I then saw that it was not for me to
try to open doors, but for this also I must
look to the Lord. I prayed that, if he wished
me to return to China, he would send me one
to whom I could commit her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>A short time passed; then a lady called,
whose life had been devoted to the training
of young women. Her beautiful Christian
character made her the one above all others
in whose care I could gladly leave my daughter.
This lady told me that in her early years
she had hoped to give her life for service in
China, but the way had been closed. She
now felt that the Lord had laid it upon her
heart to offer to take charge of my child.
Years have passed since then, and she has fulfilled
my highest expectations of her. Rarely
has a more definite answer come from a loving
Father, nor one that brought greater relief
and help; for this offer, coming as it did
in answer to my prayers, seemed to be unmistakable
proof that the Lord would keep my
child as I gave her up.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The time had almost arrived for beginning
the last preparations for the long journey to
China, when one day Ruth came in from her
play with her heavy coat almost in shreds, she
having in some way torn it on a barbed wire
fence. The coat was the only heavy one she
had, and I had planned to make it do for the
ocean voyage, intending to get a new one in
England. I tried to find a new one in the
stores, but the season was past and I could
not; and I had no time to make another. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
just took the need to the Lord and left it
there, believing that in some way he would
provide. A few days later a friend telephoned
me that her mother had recently
returned from a visit to Chicago, and wished
me to come over to see a parcel she had
brought for me. Oh, the relief that came
when I found that the parcel contained,
among other things, a handsome red cloth
ulster, which fitted Ruth perfectly. This
fresh evidence of the Lord's overshadowing
care touched me deeply. Those who have
never known such tokens of the Lord's loving
care in the little things of life can scarcely
understand the blessedness that such experiences
bring.</p>

<p>As I attempt to recall the answers to
prayer on this furlough, so many come to
mind it is impossible to record them all&mdash;help
in keeping my appointments, courage
and power for public speaking, physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
strength, and guidance in facing many difficult
problems.</p>

<p>It was at this time I formed a habit of getting
a message for a meeting on my knees.
It often seemed to me very wonderful how, as
in a flash, sometimes, an outline for a talk on
China would come. Never having kept notes,
nor even outlines of addresses, I have frequently
been placed in circumstances when I
have felt utterly cast on the Lord. And I can
testify that he never failed to give the needed
help, and the realized divine power. Yet sad,
sad is it that often at just such times, no
sooner would the address be ended than the
Satan-whispered thought would come, "I
have done well to-day."</p>

<p>Oh, is not the goodness and forbearance of
our God wonderful; wonderful that he ever
again would deign to give help when asked
for it?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A short time since I asked a dear friend

multitudes throughout the Christian world:

<p>Softly, with deep reverence in look and
tone, she replied: "It has been done all in and

<p>With deepest gratitude and praise to our
ever faithful God, I too can testify that any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
little service I have been able to do has been
done by his grace in answer to prayer.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<h3>OUR GOD OF THE IMPOSSIBLE</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Behold I am the Lord, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is there <i>anything</i>
too hard for ME?" (Jer. 32:27.)</p>

<p>"Ah, Lord God! there is <i>nothing</i> too wonderful
for thee" (Jer. 32:17, margin).</p></div>


<div class='cap'>THE following illustration of the truth,
"What is impossible with man is possible
with God," occurred while we were attending
the Keswick Convention in England, in 1910.</div>

<p>One evening my husband returned from
an evening meeting, which I had not attended,
and told me of a woman who had
come to him in great distress. She had been
an earnest Christian worker, but love for
light, trashy fiction had so grown upon her
as to work havoc in her Christian life. She
had come to Keswick three years in succession,
hoping to get victory, but had failed.</p>

<p>My whole soul went out to the poor woman;
I longed to help her. But Mr. Goforth
did not know her name, and the tent had been
so dark he could not recognize her again;
besides, there were about four thousand people
attending the convention. That night I
lay awake asking the Lord, if he knew I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
help her, to bring us together, for I, too, had
at one time been almost wrecked on the same
rock.</p>

<p>Three evenings later the tent was so
crowded that I found difficulty in getting a
seat. Just as the meeting was about to begin,
I noticed a woman change her seat twice, and
then rise a third time and come to where I
was, asking me to make room for her. I
crowded the others in the seat and made room
for her&mdash;I fear not too graciously. While
Mr. F. B. Meyer was speaking I noticed she
was in great distress, her tears falling fast.
I laid my hand on hers, and she grasped it
convulsively. At the close of the meeting I
said, "Can I help you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she replied, "there is no hope for
me; it is those cursed novels that have been
my ruin."</p>

<p>I looked at her in amazement, and almost
gasped: "Are you the one who spoke to Mr.
Goforth Saturday night?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but who are you?"</p>

<p>Scarcely able to speak for emotion, I told
her, and also of my prayer. For the next
few moments we could only weep together.
Then the Lord used me to lead the poor
crushed and broken soul back to himself. As
we parted, a few days later, her face was
beaming with the joy of the Lord.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>While addressing a gathering of Christians
in Glasgow I was giving a certain incident,
the point of which depended upon a
verse of a certain hymn. When I came to
quote the verse, it had utterly slipped my
memory. In some confusion I turned to the
leader, hoping that he could help me out; but
he said he had no idea what the hymn was.
Turning again to the people, I had to acknowledge
that my memory had failed me,
and, feeling embarrassed, I closed my message
somewhat hurriedly.</p>

<p>Sitting down, I lifted my heart in a cry to
the Lord to lead me to the verse I wanted, if
it was in the hymn-book used there. I took
up a hymn-book and opened it, and the very
first lines my eyes fell on were those of the
verse I wanted, though it was the last verse
of a long hymn. Rising again, I told the
people of my prayer and the answer, and
gave them the verse. The solemn stillness
which prevailed indicated that a deep impression
had been made. Some two years after,
a newly arrived missionary in China told me
he had been present at that meeting, and how
this little incident had been a great blessing
to him.</p>

<p>"They cried unto thee, and were delivered:
they trusted in thee, and were not confounded"
(Psa. 22:5).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Before leaving Canada we had written to
the China Inland School at Chefoo, China,
hoping to get our children admitted there;
but, shortly before we left England for
China, word reached us that both the boys'
and girls' schools were overflowing, with
long lists of waiting applicants. This was a
great blow to me, for I had been looking forward
to engaging once more in the aggressive
out-station work.</p>

<p>But the children could not be left, and
were too old to be taken away from their
studies. It seemed necessary, therefore, that
a good Christian governess should be found,
who would teach the children and take charge
of the home in my absence. All the way
across the Siberian route this matter was before
us. Earnestly did I pray that the Lord
would direct the right one to us; for I knew
that to get a young woman, who could fill the
position we wanted her for, would be very
difficult in China.</p>

<p>We had planned to go direct to our station,
but illness forced us to break the journey at
Peitaiho, where we met a young lady, the
daughter of a missionary. Many difficulties
appeared in the way of her coming on with
us, but one by one these were removed; and
when we continued our journey this young
woman was one of our party.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Time proved her to be truly God-given.
Not only was she all and more than I could
have hoped for, but the Lord answered my
prayers that her young life might be consecrated
to the Lord's service in China. She
later went through her training in England
as a nurse, and is now in China as a missionary
of the China Inland Mission.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The summer holidays at Peitaiho were
drawing to a close. Heavy rains had fallen,
making the roads to the station, six miles
distant, almost impassable. Word had come
that our two children, Ruth and Wallace,
must leave by the Monday morning train in
order to reach the steamer at Tientsin, which
was to take them to Chefoo, where they were
attending the China Inland Mission schools.
All day Saturday and Sunday torrents of
rain continued to fall, with a fierce wind
from the north.</p>

<p>I rose before daybreak Monday morning,
to find the rain still pouring down in torrents.
I roused the servant, and sent him off to
make sure about the chair, cart, and donkeys.
A little later he returned to say that the chair
had been blown over, and the chair-bearers
had refused to come. The carters also refused,
saying the roads were impassable; and
even the donkey boys said they would not go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>I was truly at "wit's end corner." I went
alone, and did not take time even to kneel
down, but just lifted up my heart to my
Father to stop the rain and open a way for
the children to get to the station. I felt a
sudden, strong confidence that the Lord
would help, and going out again I ordered
the servant to run fast to the village near by
and get fresh donkeys. He was unwilling,
saying it was useless, no one would venture;
but I said: "Go at once, I know they will
come."</p>

<p>While he was gone the children had their
breakfast, boxes were closed and taken out,
and the children put on their wraps. Then
the rain stopped! Just then the servant returned
with several donkeys. Within five
minutes, children and baggage were on donkeys,
and started for the station. A few
hours later one of the donkey boys returned
with a hastily written note from Ruth, saying
they had reached the station without any
mishap, and quite dry; for it had not rained
on the way over, but had started to pour
again just after they had got on the train.
The rain continued for days after.</p>

<p>At the close of our four months of meetings
in Great Britain, in 1910, I felt a strong
desire to send a gift of five dollars to five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
different objects in Britain, to show in a
practical way our sympathy with the workers
in these various branches of the Lord's
work.</p>

<p>My husband was in the midst of his accounts
when I asked him to give me five
pounds for this purpose. He told me it was
impossible, as we had barely enough for the
journey to China. As I left him I wondered
why I seemed to have these gifts so definitely
laid upon me to send away, when there was
no money. Reasoning that if the thing were
really of the Lord he could himself give me
what he wished me to send, I put the matter
from my mind.</p>

<p>That evening's mail brought a letter from
a stranger living some distance away, judging
from the postmark; for the letter had
no address, and was not signed. The letter
said:</p>

<p>"I do not know you, nor have I met you,
but the Lord seems to have laid it on my
heart to send you this five-pound note as a
farewell gift, to do what you think best
with."</p>

<p>It was with a joyful heart I sent off the
gifts to the five Christian workers in Britain.
Had the giver said it was "for work in
China," as was usually the case, I could not
have used it for any other purpose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>How to get the sewing done for my family
and yet meet the pressing calls made upon
me as the wife of a pioneer missionary, for
almost thirty years has been perhaps the most
difficult and constant problem of my missionary
life. In connection with the solving of
this problem, I have seen some of the most
precious evidences of God's willingness to
undertake in the daily details of life.</p>

<p>The following story must be given in detail
to be really understood, as one of the
striking instances of how God, in his own
wonderful way, can work out the seemingly
impossible.</p>

<p>Returning home to our station from an
unusually strenuous autumn's touring, I
planned as usual to give the month of December
to the children's sewing, so as to
leave January largely free for a Bible-women's
training class. But my health
broke down, and I could make scarcely any
headway with the thirty-five or forty garments
which had to be made or fixed over,
before the children returned to their school
in Chefoo. By the eighteenth of December
we decided to cancel the class on account of
my ill-health; and to all the women, except
one whom I entirely forgot, I sent word not
to come.</p>

<p>As the days passed, the burden of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
almost untouched sewing became very great.
At last I cried to the Lord to undertake for
me. And how wonderfully he did! On December
twenty-eighth, when I was conducting
the Chinese women's prayer-meeting, I
noticed in the audience Mrs. Lu, the very
woman to whom I had forgotten to send
word. She had come a long distance, with
her little child, over rough mountainous
roads, so I felt very sorry for my thoughtlessness.
Mrs. Lu accompanied me home,
and I gave her money for a barrow on which
to return the next day. I then sat down to
the sewing machine. The woman stood beside
me for a little, and then said:</p>

<p>"You are looking very tired, Mrs. Goforth;
let me run the machine for you."</p>

<p>"You!" I exclaimed, astonished, "why,
you don't know how."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," she replied.</p>

<p>She was so insistent that at last, in fear
and trembling, I ventured to let her try&mdash;for
I had only one needle. It took but a few
moments to convince me she was a real expert
at the machine. When I urged her to
stay and help me, she replied that, since the
class was given up, she would return home on
the morrow.</p>

<p>That night I was puzzled. Why should
the Lord lead this woman to me&mdash;the only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
one, so far as we knew, who could do the
machine work&mdash;and then permit her to
leave? I could only lay the whole matter
before the Lord, and trust him to undertake.
And again he answered. That night a fierce
storm came on, lasting several days and
making the roads quite impassable. Mrs. Lu,
finding herself storm-tied, gladly gave all her
time to me. The roads remained impassable
for a whole month, during which time I did
not once need to sit down at the machine.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>While in Tientsin with my children during
the revolution in 1912, I had occasion to go
into the Chinese city with my servant. We
visited three stores. On our way home by
the tramway I discovered I had lost a five-dollar
bill and one of my gloves. I had foolishly
put the bill inside the glove. Ashamed
to let the Chinese servant know of my carelessness,
I sent him home when we reached
the end of the tram line. As soon as he was
out of sight I took the tram back to the city.
On the way I confessed to the Lord my carelessness,
and asked him to keep the glove and
money, and lead me to where they were. I
retraced my steps back to two of the stores
where we had been. As I entered the second,
which was a shoe store, a number of men
were in the shop; but there, right in sight of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
all, on the floor lay my glove, and I knew of
course with the five dollars inside. It was
with a heart full of gratitude to my loving
Heavenly Father, and an enlarged vision of
his love, that I picked up the glove and returned
home that day.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On one occasion when on furlough with
several little children, and my husband in
China, I had no settled home. When the
time came to do the sewing for the long journey
back to China, I had simply no way to
get it done. I just had to look to the Lord;
and, as so often before, he was again faithful,
and opened the way. When shopping
down town, one day, I met a minister's wife
from a distant country charge, who said: "I
want you to come with all your children, and
get your sewing done with me. A number of
the ladies of our congregation sew well, and
will be delighted to help you."</p>

<p>I gratefully accepted her invitation, and
while staying with her a sewing-bee was held
in the church. In one week the sewing was
finished, which would have taken me many
weeks of hard, constant labor to accomplish
alone.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The winter of our return from China,
after the Boxer tragedies, I felt keenly the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
need of a good sewing machine, as I could
not possibly do the children's sewing by hand
and still get time for meetings. One day, as
my husband was leaving on a deputation
tour, I asked him for money for a machine.
He assured me it was impossible; that we
had only sufficient for bare necessities. I
knew well he would gladly give me money for
the machine if he had it. So I laid my need
before my Father, confident that he knew it
was a real need, and that according to his
promise he could and would supply it.</p>

<p>I was so sure that somehow the money
would come, that I went down town especially
to choose a suitable machine. I found
it would cost thirty-six dollars. A few days
later I received a letter from a band of ladies
in Mount Forest, Ontario, enclosing twenty-three
dollars and some odd cents, and saying:
"Please accept the enclosed to buy something
you have lost as our substitute in China."
Only a day or two later another letter came,
from quite another part of Ontario, enclosing
twelve dollars and some cents. The two
amounts came to exactly the sum I needed to
purchase the machine.</p>

<p>The second letter stated that the money
was sent to help me buy a sewing machine.
It has always been a puzzle to me how they
came to send the money in that way, for I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
had not spoken to any one but my husband
about wanting a machine. When Mr. Goforth
returned I was able to show him
what the Lord could give me, though he
could not.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I had been holding a class for women at
an out-station, staying in the home of the
elder, Dr. Fan. The day before I was to
return home, Mrs. Fan asked me to go with
her to visit a very sick boy whom the missionary
doctor had sent home from the boys'
school, Wei Hwei, because of his having
tuberculosis of the lungs. Mrs. Fan told me
the mother was in great distress, and begged
me to come and pray with her. I found the
lad in a truly pitiable condition. His mouth
was swollen, his face a ghastly hue, and
every moment a cough racked his frame. He
seemed to me quite beyond hope, and looked
as if he could not live long.</p>

<p>On our way home to Mrs. Fan's, the message
of James 5:14, 15, kept coming persistently
to me, as if spoken by a voice: "Is
any sick among you? let him call for the
elders of the church; and let them pray over
him, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the prayer of faith shall save the
sick, and the Lord shall raise him up."</p>

<p>I simply could not get away from those
words. On reaching Dr. Fan's home, I sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
for him, and asked if he and the other elders
would be willing to pray with me over the
lad. He consented, though at first he seemed
rather dubious. There were quite a number
of Christians gathered around as we placed
the boy in our midst. All knelt down, and I
read the words from James. I told them
plainly that I could not say that it was indeed
the Lord's will to heal the boy; all that was
clear to me was that we must obey as far as
we had light, and leave the rest in God's
hands for life or death. Several prayed, and
we then dispersed.</p>

<p>Early the following morning I left for
home. Circumstances prevented my return
to that place, and in time we moved to another
field. More than two years later, while
visiting Wei Hwei, I met Mrs. Fan, who told
me that the lad had completely recovered and
was then working with his father. Still a
year later I met Dr. Fan, and upon inquiring
about the lad, the doctor told me he was perfectly
well, and was in business in Wei Hwei
City.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The power of intercession is shown in the
following two incidents:</p>

<p>In the winter of 1905 a call came for my
husband to hold special meetings in Manchuria.
On reaching Liao Yang for these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
meetings, one of the missionaries showed him
a letter from Mr. Moffat, of Korea, which
said: "I have a thousand Christians here who
have promised to pray for Mr. Goforth, and
I know their prayers will prevail with God."
Can we doubt that their prayers had something
to do with the marvelous revival movement
which followed?</p>

<p>When in England, in 1909, my husband
was the guest of a lady in London who was
noted for her power in intercession. He was
telling her of the great revival movements he
had been through, which took place in different
provinces of China; and she asked him to
look at her diary, in which were notes of
times when she had been led out in special
intercession for Mr. Goforth. These dates
exactly corresponded to the times of greatest
revival power.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A few months after we returned to China
from a furlough, I invited a certain missionary
and his wife and children to pay us a
visit. Peculiarly touching circumstances had
led me to give this invitation. Both husband
and wife were in ill health, and greatly
needed a change. They resided in a far inland
station, quite cut off from other missionaries.
They were not connected with any
Society, and were looking only to the Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
for their support. Just as these friends had
started toward us, on their five-days' journey,
smallpox broke out at our station, and one of
the missionaries died. A telegram was sent,
hoping to catch them before they left, but it
did not reach them until they were a short
distance from our station. Then the whole
family had to turn around, and once more
take the long, trying journey, homeward. As
the weather was very cold at the time, one
could imagine what a terrible trial to faith
the whole experience meant to them. I felt
so deeply for them that I planned to send
sufficient to cover at least the expense of the
journey. But, on getting out of quarantine,
I found I could not draw on our treasurer
for the fifty dollars needed, as Mr. Goforth
was not at home. However, the Lord had
seen the need long before I felt it, and had
the exact amount ready. Three days after I
got out of quarantine I received a letter from
Mr. Horace Goven, of the Faith Mission,
Glasgow, enclosing a draft for five pounds
which, at the rate of exchange at that time,
came to fifty dollars Mexican. The gift
came from the workers of the mission, and
he stated that they wished me to accept it as a
personal gift. Needless to say, the draft was
sent off that same day to the needy friends in
the far-off station.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>On one occasion, while we were temporarily
stationed at Wei Hwei, Honan, I was
called to nurse a fellow missionary who had
contracted black smallpox. This missionary
died; and it was while shut away from every
one during the time of quarantine that I had
the following experience:</p>

<p>I awoke suddenly one night feeling greatly
troubled for one in Canada. So strong was
the impression that this friend needed my
prayers, that I felt compelled to rise and
spend a long time wrestling with God on this
one's behalf; then peace came, and I again
slept.</p>

<p>As soon as I was out of quarantine I wrote
to my friend and told of this experience, giving
the date. In time the answer came, which
said that&mdash;though no date could be given, as
no note had been made of it&mdash;as far as
could be judged, it was about the same time
that I had had the burden of prayer that my
friend was passing through a time of such
temptation as seemed almost overwhelming.
But the letter said: "I was brought through
victoriously; I know that it was your prayers
that helped me."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The following incident may seem trifling
to some; but to me no answer in my life ever
brought more intense relief. For this reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
I have reserved it, as the final testimony of
the original prayer record.</p>

<p>My husband had gone to hold revival meetings
in a distant province, and while he was
away I went with my Bible-woman to a certain
out-station at the urgent request of the
Christians, to preach at a four-days' "theatrical,"
which brought great crowds. The four
days there were enough to wear out the
strongest; for many hours daily we had to
face unruly crowds coming and going; and
at the end of our stay I turned my face homeward
utterly worn out. My one thought was
to get to Wei Hwei, our next station, for a
few days' rest with my youngest children,
who were attending school there. A sight of
them, I knew, would recover my energies
better than anything else.</p>

<p>But in getting home I in some way lost the
key of the money-drawer. It was Friday,
and the train for Wei Hwei left on Saturday
at ten o'clock. Different persons came
for money, but I had to put them off with
some excuse. There was too much money in
the drawer for me to leave with the key lying
around somewhere; besides, I myself could
not go without money.</p>

<p>As soon as I had my supper I started
searching everywhere. Drawers, pigeonholes,
shelves, were all searched in vain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
After hunting for two hours, until I was too
exhausted to hunt any more, I suddenly
thought, "I have never prayed about it."
Stopping still just where I stood by the
dining-table, I lifted my heart to the Lord.
"O Lord, you know how much I need a rest;
you know how much I long to see the children;
pity me, and lead me to the key."</p>

<p>Then, without wasting a step, I walked
through the dining-room, hall, and women's
guest room into Mr. Goforth's study, to the
book-case (which covers one side of the
room), opened the door, slipped two books
aside, and there was the key. So near did
the Lord seem at that moment that I could
almost feel his bodily presence. It was not
that I remembered putting the key there, but
he led me there.</p>

<p>Yes, I <i>know</i> God answers prayer.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<h3>TO HIS PRAISE!</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They shall abundantly utter the memory
of thy great goodness."</p></div>


<div class='cap'>THIS chapter is written more than seven
years later than the foregoing, in further
testimony and praise.</div>

<p>Returning to Canada at the time of the
Great War, we came face to face with a
serious financial crisis. Only two ways
seemed open to us. One was to lay our
affairs frankly before the Board, showing
that our salary was quite insufficient, with
war conditions and prices, to meet our requirements.
The other course was to just
go forward, get a suitable home and whatever
we required, and trust our Father to
supply what was needed above our income.
We decided on the latter course.</p>

<p>A dear daughter felt indignant that we
should have a salary insufficient for our
needs; but we assured her that to trust God
for what was lacking was not begging. The
day came when this child and myself took
possession of our new home. As we entered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the dining-room we found a large mail from
China on the table.</p>

<p>One letter was forwarded from the lady
in Australia whose gifts, in the past, seemed
always to have met some felt need. Her
letter enclosed fifty pounds, with the expressed
wish that thirty pounds should be
used for work in China, but twenty pounds
was to be used to meet some personal need. I
handed the letter to my daughter, saying:
"Shall we not believe that God will undertake
for us? It seems to me as if our Father
were beside us saying, 'My child, take this
hundred dollars as an earnest of what I am
going to do for you.'"</p>

<p>Tears stood in her eyes as my daughter
gave the letter back, saying: "Mother, we
don't trust God half enough!"</p>

<p>Were I to attempt to write the history of
the months that followed, a long chapter
would be required; but my testimony along
this line is surely sufficient.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was on this same furlough that I came
to have an enlarged vision of my Heavenly
Father's willingness to undertake in what
some might term the minor details of everyday
life. Missionaries, especially we missionary
women, know only too well how we
are criticized in the matter of dress, when in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the homeland and when traveling. I have
had, through the years, not only many amusing
but trying experiences in this connection,
and I resolved to make the question of
dress a definite matter of prayer. And I
rejoice to testify that the result of this decision
became a constant source of wonder
and praise. Yes, I found the Lord could
guide me even in trimming my hat to his
glory! That is, so that I could stand up before
an audience and not bring discredit to
my Master. Praise his name!</p>

<div class='poem'>
"There is nothing too great for his power,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And nothing too small for his love!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>At the time of the Great War a son had
gone to England with the first Canadian contingent.
When this news reached us in
China, I began to pray definitely that the
Lord would use my son's gifts in the best
way for his country's good, but would keep
him back from the trenches and from actual
warfare. My boy did not know of this
prayer.</p>

<p>Some weeks after reaching England he
was looking forward to leaving for the
trenches in France, when orders came that
he was needed in the Orderly Room, and his
unit left without him. Months later a call
came for volunteers, to fill the great gaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
made at the time of the first use of gas. My
boy resigned his position, and joined the
company of volunteers to be sent to France.
Just before they were to leave he was again
sent for from Headquarters, and told he was
to go to the Canadian Base in France as
adjutant. His duties in this capacity kept
him at the Forwarding Base. A year later
he again planned to resign, in order to get to
the trenches. He had begun making arrangements
for this step, when he had a fall from
his horse, which caused him to be invalided
home to Canada, where he was kept till the
close of the war.</p>

<p>It would indeed be difficult to persuade his
mother that all this happened by chance; for
one day, when in great distress, expecting
any day a cable to say he had left for the
trenches, I received a most clear assurance
from the Lord that he had the boy in his
keeping.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>After our return to China, when in great
trouble, I prayed the Lord to grant me a
clear sign of his favor by giving me a certain
petition, which affected a child in the homeland.
The request was a complicated one,
including several definite details. A little
more than a month later, a letter reached me
from the one for whom I had asked the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Lord's favor. She wrote joyously, telling
that she had received just what I had asked
for, and in every detail as I had prayed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When my husband resigned the regular
field work of Changte, Honan, it became
necessary for us to find a home elsewhere.
The only suitable place, meeting all our requirements,
was on the hills at Kikungshan,
South Honan. On going there to get a site
for our home, though we looked for more
than a week, we could find no place. As we
started down the hill, one morning soon after
midnight, I was feeling our failure very
keenly, for we had given up our old home.
When my husband saw how bad I felt, as
he told me later, he began to cry earnestly to
the Lord to give us a site. And before we
reached the station the assurance had come
that we would get a place. A friend on the
train, traveling third class, saw us getting on
the second class, and came in for a few words
before getting off the train. When he heard
we had failed to get a site, he said:</p>

<p>"I know of a beautiful site which our Mission
is reserving for a future missionary.
I'll ask them to give it to you."</p>

<p>A few days later the treasurer of this Mission
wrote us that they had unanimously and
gladly voted to give us the site.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>I am now writing these closing words in
our God-given home, built on this beautiful
site, one of the most lovely spots to be found
in China. So from this quiet mountain
retreat, a monument of what God can give in
answer to prayer, this little book of Prayer
Testimonies is sent forth.</p>

<p>As the past has been reviewed, and God's
wonderful faithfulness recalled, there has
come a great sense of regret that I have not
trusted God more, and asked more of him,
both for my family and the Chinese. Yes, it
is truly wonderful! But the wonder is not
that God <i>can</i> answer prayer, <i>but that he does</i>,
when we so imperfectly meet the conditions
clearly laid down in his Word.</p>

<p>In recent years I have often tested myself
by these conditions, when weeks, and perhaps
months, have passed without some answer to
prayer, and there has come a conscious spiritual
sagging. As the discerning soul can
plainly see, all the conditions mentioned in
the list below may be included in the one
word "Abide."</p>

<h3>VICTORY FOUND</h3>


<div class='cap'>AT THE close of this little volume it
seems fitting to recount again a wonderful
personal experience, narrated in The Sunday
School Times of December 7, 1918.</div>

<p>I do not remember the time when I did not
have in some degree a love for the Lord Jesus
Christ as my Saviour. When not quite
twelve years of age, at a revival meeting, I
publicly accepted and confessed Christ as my
Lord and Master.</p>

<p>From that time there grew up in my heart
a deep yearning to know Christ in a more
real way, for he seemed so unreal, so far
away and visionary. One night when still
quite young I remember going out under the
trees in my parents' garden and, looking up
into the starlit heavens, I longed with intense
longing to feel Christ near me. As I
knelt down there on the grass, alone with
God, Job's cry became mine, "Oh, that I
knew where I might find him!" Could I have
borne it had I known then that almost forty
years would pass before that yearning would
be satisfied?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>With the longing to know Christ, literally
to "find" him, came a passionate desire to
<i>serve</i> him. But, oh, what a terrible nature I
had! Passionate, proud, self-willed, indeed
just full was I of those things that I knew
were unlike Christ.</p>

<p>The following years of half-hearted conflict
with sinful self must be passed over till
about the fifth year of our missionary work
in China. I grieve to say that the new life
in a foreign land with its trying climate, provoking
servants, and altogether irritating
conditions, seemed to have developed rather
than subdued my natural disposition.</p>

<p>One day (I can never forget it), as I sat
inside the house by a paper window at dusk,
two Chinese Christian women sat down on
the other side. They began talking about me,
and (wrongly, no doubt) I listened. One
said, "Yes, she is a hard worker, a zealous
preacher, and&mdash;yes, she nearly loves us; but,
oh, what a temper she has! <i>If she would
only live more as she preaches!</i>"</p>

<p>Then followed a full and true delineation
of my life and character. So true, indeed,
was it, as to crush out all sense of annoyance
and leave me humbled to the dust. I saw
then how useless, how worse than useless,
was it for me to come to China to preach
Christ and not <i>live</i> Christ. But how could I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
live Christ? I knew some (including my
dear husband) who had a peace and a power,&mdash;yes,
and a something I could not define,
that I had not; and often I longed to know
the secret.</p>

<p>Was it possible, with such a nature as
mine, ever to become patient and gentle?</p>

<p>Was it possible that I could ever really
stop worrying?</p>

<p>Could I, in a word, ever hope to be able to
live Christ as well as preach him?</p>

<p>I knew I loved Christ; and again and again
I had proved my willingness to give up all
for his sake. But I knew, too, that one hot
flash of temper with the Chinese, or with the
children before the Chinese, would largely
undo weeks, perhaps months, of self-sacrificing
service.</p>

<p>The years that followed led often through
the furnace. The Lord knew that nothing
but fire could destroy the dross and subdue
my stubborn will. Those years may be
summed up in one line: "Fighting (not finding),
following, keeping, <i>struggling</i>." Yes,
and failing! Sometimes in the depths of
despair over these failures; then going on
determined to do <i>my</i> best,&mdash;and what a poor
best it was!</p>

<p>In the year 1905, and later, as I witnessed
the wonderful way the Lord was leading my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
husband, and saw the Holy Spirit's power in
his life and message, I came to seek very
definitely for the fulness of the Holy Spirit.
It was a time of deep heart-searching. The
heinousness of sin was revealed as never
before. Many, many things had to be set
right toward man and God. I learned then
what "paying the price" meant. Those were
times of wonderful mountain-top experiences,
and I came to honor the Holy Spirit
and seek his power for the overcoming of sin
in a new way. But Christ still remained, as
before, distant, afar off, and I longed increasingly
to know&mdash;to <i>find</i> him. Although
I had much more power over besetting sins,
yet there were times of great darkness and
defeat.</p>

<p>It was during one of these latter times
that we were forced to return to Canada, in
June of 1916. My husband's health prevented
him from public speaking, and it
seemed that this duty for us both was to fall
on me. But I dreaded facing the Home
Church without some spiritual uplift,&mdash;a
fresh vision for myself. The Lord saw this
heart-hunger, and in his own glorious way
he fulfilled literally the promise, "He satisfieth
the longing soul, and <i>filleth</i> the hungry
soul with goodness" (Psa. 107:9, A. V.).</p>

<p>A spiritual conference was to be held the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
latter part of June at Niagara-on-the-Lake,
Ontario, and to this I was led. One day I
went to the meeting rather against my inclination,
for it was so lovely under the trees
by the beautiful lake. The speaker was a
stranger to me, but from almost the first his
message gripped me. Victory over Sin!
Why, this was what I had fought for, had
hungered for, all my life! Was it possible?</p>

<p>The speaker went on to describe very simply
an ordinary Christian life experience&mdash;sometimes
on the mountain-top, with visions
of God; then again would come the sagging,
and dimming of vision, coldness, discouragement,
and perhaps definite disobedience and
a time of down-grade experience. Then perhaps
a sorrow, or even some special mercy,
would bring the wanderer back to his Lord.</p>

<p>The speaker asked for all those who felt
this to be a picture of their experience to raise
the hand. I was sitting in the front seat, and
shame only kept me from raising my hand
at once. But I did so want to get all God had
for me, and I determined to be true; and
after a struggle I raised my hand. Wondering
if others were like myself, I ventured to
glance back and saw many hands were
raised, though the audience was composed
almost entirely of Christian workers, ministers,
and missionaries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The leader then went on to say <i>that</i> life
which he had described was <i>not</i> the life God
planned or wished for His children. He described
the higher life of peace, rest in the
Lord, of power and freedom from struggle,
worry, care. As I listened I could scarcely
believe it could be true, yet my whole soul
was moved so that it was with the greatest
difficulty I could control my emotion. I saw
then, though dimly, that I was nearing the
goal for which I had been aiming all my life.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, soon after daybreak,
I went over on my knees carefully and
prayerfully all the passages on the Victorious
Life that were given in a little yellow leaflet
that the speaker had distributed.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> What a
comfort and strength it was to see how clear
God's Word was that victory, not defeat, was
his will for his children, and to see what wonderful
provision he had made! Later, during
the days that followed, clearer light came. I
did what I was asked to do&mdash;I quietly but
definitely accepted Christ as my Saviour
from the <i>power</i> of sin as I had so long before
accepted him as my Saviour from the <i>penalty</i>
of sin. And on this I rested.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>
<p>I left Niagara, realizing, however, there
was still something I had not got. I felt
much as the blind man must have felt when
he said, "I see men as trees, walking"
(A. V.). I had begun to see light, but dimly.</p>

<p>The day after reaching home I picked up
a little booklet, "The Life That Wins,"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
which I had not read before, and going to my
son's bedside I told him it was the personal
testimony of one whom God had used to
bring great blessing into my life. I then read
it aloud till I came to the words, "At last I
realized that Jesus Christ was actually and
literally within me." I stopped amazed. The
sun seemed suddenly to come from under a
cloud and flood my whole soul with light.
How blind I'd been! I saw at last the secret
of victory&mdash;it was simply Jesus Christ himself&mdash;his
own life lived out in the believer.
But the thought of victory was for the moment
lost sight of in the inexpressible joy of
realizing <span class="smcap">Christ's Indwelling Presence</span>!
Like a tired, worn-out wanderer finding home
at last I just <i>rested</i> in him. Rested in his
love&mdash;in himself. And, oh, the peace and
joy that came flooding my life! A restfulness
and quietness of spirit I never thought could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
be mine took possession of me so naturally.
Literally a new life began for me, or rather <i>in</i>
me. It was just "the Life that is Christ."</p>

<p>The first step I took in this new life was to
get standing on God's own Word, and not
merely on man's teaching or even on a personal
experience. And as I studied especially
the truth of Christ's indwelling, victory over
sin, and God's bountiful provision, the Word
was fairly illumined with new light.</p>

<p>The years that have passed have been years
of blessed fellowship with Christ and of
joy in his service. A friend asked me not
long ago if I could give in a sentence the
after result in my life of what I said had
come to me in 1916, and I replied, "Yes, it
can be all summed up in one word,
'Resting.'"</p>

<p>Some have asked, "But have you never
sinned?" Yes, I grieve to say I have. Sin
is the one thing I abhor&mdash;for it is the one
thing that can, if unrepented of, separate us,
not from Christ, but from the consciousness
of his presence. But I have learned that
there is instantaneous forgiveness and restoration
to be had <i>always</i>. That there need be
no times of despair.</p>

<p>One of the blessed results of this life is
not only the consciousness of Christ's presence,
but the <i>reality</i> of his presence as manifested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in definite results when, in the daily
details of life, matters are left with him and
he has undertaken.</p>

<p>My own thought of him is beautifully expressed
in Spurgeon's words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>God knew the frailty of man, that his heart was
"desperately wicked," that even his righteousness was
"as filthy rags," that man's only hope for victory
over sin must come from the God-ward side. He,
therefore, made kingly provision so rich, so sufficient,
so exceeding abundant, that as we study it, we feel
we have tapped a mine of wealth, too deep to fathom.
Just a few suggestions of its riches:</p>

<p>God's <i>greatest</i> provision is the gift of a part of
His Own Being in the person of the Holy Spirit.
The following are but some of the many things the
Holy Spirit does for us, as recorded in the Word:</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem2'>
He begets us into the family of God.&mdash;John 3:6.<br />

He is the source of power and fruitfulness.&mdash;John 7:38, 39.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Some of the victorious <i>results</i> in our life, as Christ
has His way in us, are shown in:</p></div>

2 Timothy 3:17.<br />
Jude 24.<br />
John 15:7.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To the seeker for further Scripture help the writer
would suggest a plan that has proved a great blessing
to herself.</p>

<p>Read the Psalms through, making careful record
of all the statements of what the Lord was to the
writers of the Psalms. The list will surprise you.
Then on your knees go over them one by one, with
the prayer that Christ may be to you what he was to
David and the others.</p>

<p>Take a Cruden's, or better still a Young's, concordance
and look up the texts under such headings as
Love, Fulness, Power, Riches, Grace, etc., grouping
them into usable Bible studies. As a sample, taking
this last word, "grace"; the more one studies it the
more wonderful does it become. Here are some of
these headings:</p></div>

<div class='poem'>
Grace for grace.&mdash;John 1:16.<br />
Sufficient grace.&mdash;2 Cor. 12:9.<br />
More Grace.&mdash;James 4:6.<br />
All Grace.&mdash;2 Cor. 9:8.<br />
Abundant grace.&mdash;Rom. 5:17.<br />
Exceeding abundant grace.&mdash;1 Tim. 1:14.<br />
Exceeding riches of His grace.&mdash;Eph. 2:17.<br /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But let us remember that to simply know of riches
will never materially benefit us. We must make them
our own. All fulness dwells in Christ. It is only
as we "apprehend" (which means take hold or take
in) Christ through the Holy Spirit can it be possible
for these spiritual riches to become ours. The slogan
of this glorious life in Christ is just "Let go and let
God."</p></div>
